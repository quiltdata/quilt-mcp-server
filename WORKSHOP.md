## Getting Started

### Understanding Quilt MCP

Quilt MCP gives Claude the ability to:

1. **Discover Data**: Find S3 buckets and browse their contents
2. **Query Data**: Use Athena or Tabulator to query data catalogs
3. **Create Packages**: Bundle data, metadata, and visualizations
4. **Visualize**: Generate interactive charts and dashboards

### Basic Concepts

- **Bucket**: An S3 bucket containing your data
- **Package**: A versioned bundle of files with metadata
- **Catalog**: Quilt's web interface for browsing packages
- **Athena**: AWS service for SQL queries on S3 data
- **Tabulator**: Quilt's fast query engine for package metadata

---

## Workshop Exercises

### Exercise 1: Discover Your Data (5 minutes)

Let's explore what data you have available.

**Prompt**:
```
Show me what S3 buckets are available in my AWS account.
```

**Follow-up**:
```
Browse the contents of [bucket-name] and show me the top-level folders.
```

**What you'll learn**: How to navigate your S3 data landscape.

---

### Exercise 2: Query Data with Athena (10 minutes)

Now let's query some data using SQL.

#### Prerequisites
- You have an Athena database configured
- Your data is cataloged in AWS Glue

**Prompt**:
```
List the databases available in Athena.
```

**Then**:
```
Show me the tables in the [database-name] database.
```

**Query your data**:
```
Query the [table-name] table in [database-name] and show me the first 10 rows.
```

**Example with filtering**:
```
Query the genomics_db.rna_seq table for genes BRCA1, TP53, and MYC. 
Show me sample_id, gene_name, and expression_level columns.
```

**What you'll learn**: How to explore and query structured data.

---

### Exercise 3: Search Package Metadata with Tabulator (10 minutes)

Tabulator provides fast searches across package metadata.

**Prompt**:
```
Search for packages in bucket [bucket-name] that contain the word "analysis" 
in their metadata.
```

**Explore package contents**:
```
Show me what files are in the [namespace/package-name] package.
```

**Query package metadata**:
```
Find all packages in [bucket-name] created in the last 30 days.
```

**What you'll learn**: How to find and explore Quilt packages.

---

### Exercise 4: Create a Simple Package (15 minutes)

Let's create your first Quilt package!

#### Step 1: Create a README

**Prompt**:
```
Create a README file for a new package called "workshop/my-first-package". 
The README should explain that this is a test package created during the 
Quilt MCP workshop and include today's date.
```

#### Step 2: Upload Files to S3

**Prompt**:
```
Upload this README to S3 bucket [your-bucket] with key "workshop/README.md".
```

#### Step 3: Create the Package

**Prompt**:
```
Create a Quilt package named "workshop/my-first-package" in bucket [your-bucket] 
that includes the README file I just uploaded at s3://[your-bucket]/workshop/README.md.
Add metadata with tags: ["workshop", "test"] and description: "My first Quilt package".
```

**What you'll learn**: The basic package creation workflow.

---

### Exercise 5: Advanced Query â†’ Visualize â†’ Package (30 minutes)

This is our capstone exercise! We'll query data, create a visualization, and package everything together.

#### Scenario
You're analyzing RNA-seq gene expression data and want to create an interactive visualization package.

#### Step 1: Query the Data

**Prompt**:
```
Query the genomics_db.rna_seq table using Athena. 
Get sample_id, gene_name, and expression_level for genes: BRCA1, TP53, MYC.
Save the results.
```

#### Step 2: Create a Visualization

**Prompt**:
```
Using the query results, create an interactive box plot showing expression_level 
by gene_name, grouped by sample_id. Use the "genomics" color scheme.
```

> **Note**: This uses the new `create_data_visualization` tool which generates ECharts JSON for interactive plots in the Quilt catalog.

#### Step 3: Create a Comprehensive README

**Prompt**:
```
Create a detailed README for this analysis package that includes:
1. Title: "RNA-Seq Gene Expression Analysis"
2. Overview of what genes were analyzed
3. Summary statistics from the data
4. Description of the visualization
5. Data source information
6. Creation date and author
```

#### Step 4: Upload Everything to S3

**Prompt**:
```
Upload the following files to s3://[your-bucket]/workshop/rna-analysis/:
1. The visualization files (quilt_summarize.json, boxplot JSON, and data CSV)
2. The README markdown file
3. The original query results as CSV
```

#### Step 5: Create the Final Package

**Prompt**:
```
Create a Quilt package named "workshop/rna-seq-analysis" that includes:
- The visualization files (so it renders in Quilt catalog)
- The README
- The raw query results
Add metadata with:
- tags: ["workshop", "rna-seq", "genomics", "visualization"]
- description: "RNA-seq expression analysis with interactive visualization"
- workflow: "Athena query â†’ visualization â†’ package"
```

#### Step 6: Verify in Quilt Catalog

Open your Quilt catalog in a browser:
```
https://[your-quilt-catalog-url]/b/[bucket]/packages/workshop/rna-seq-analysis
```

You should see:
- âœ… Interactive box plot rendered at the top
- âœ… README with analysis description
- âœ… Raw data available for download
- âœ… Metadata tags and description

**What you'll learn**: The complete workflow from query to publishable analysis package.

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Continue doesn't see MCP tools

**Symptoms**: Claude responds "I don't have access to Quilt tools" or tools list is empty

**Solutions**:
1. **Verify Continue configuration**:
   - Open config: `Cmd+Shift+P` â†’ "Continue: Open Config"
   - Check `mcpServers` section exists and is valid JSON
   - Verify `command`, `args`, and `env` are correct

2. **Check `uv` installation**:
   ```bash
   uvx --version
   ```
   If not found, reinstall `uv`

3. **Restart VS Code completely**:
   - **Mac**: `Cmd+Q` (not just close window!)
   - **Windows/Linux**: Close all windows or `Alt+F4`
   - Relaunch VS Code

4. **Check Developer Console**:
   - `Help` â†’ `Toggle Developer Tools`
   - Look for MCP errors in Console tab

5. **Test MCP server manually**:
   ```bash
   uvx --from quilt-mcp quilt-mcp
   ```
   Should start without errors

### Issue: AWS authentication errors

**Symptoms**: "Access Denied" or "Credentials not found"

**Solutions**:
1. Verify AWS credentials: `aws sts get-caller-identity`
2. Check AWS_PROFILE in MCP config matches your profile
3. Ensure your IAM user has permissions for S3, Athena, Glue
4. Try setting credentials explicitly:
   ```json
   "env": {
     "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID": "your-key",
     "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY": "your-secret",
     "AWS_REGION": "us-east-1"
   }
   ```

### Issue: Athena queries fail

**Symptoms**: "Database not found" or "Table not found"

**Solutions**:
1. Verify database exists: Ask Claude to list Athena databases
2. Check table names: Ask Claude to show tables in database
3. Ensure Athena has an output location configured in AWS
4. Verify IAM permissions for Athena and Glue

### Issue: Package creation fails

**Symptoms**: "Package creation failed" or "S3 upload error"

**Solutions**:
1. Verify bucket exists and you have write permissions
2. Check bucket name doesn't have typos
3. Ensure files were uploaded to S3 before creating package
4. Try uploading files and creating package in separate steps

### Issue: Visualizations don't render

**Symptoms**: Package creates but no visualization appears

**Solutions**:
1. Verify `quilt_summarize.json` was uploaded to package root
2. Check that visualization JSON files are in the package
3. Ensure file paths in `quilt_summarize.json` match actual files
4. Open browser console in Quilt catalog to check for errors

## Best Practices

### 1. Organize Your Packages

Use consistent naming:
```
[team]/[project]-[type]
Examples:
  - genomics/rna-seq-analysis
  - ml/model-training-v1
  - research/experiment-001
```

### 2. Always Include READMEs

Every package should have a README that explains:
- What data is included
- How it was generated
- Who created it
- When it was created

### 3. Use Metadata Tags

Tag packages for easy discovery:
```
tags: ["domain", "data-type", "project", "status"]
Examples:
  - ["genomics", "rna-seq", "cancer-study", "published"]
  - ["ml", "training-data", "model-v2", "production"]
```

### 4. Visualize Your Results

Include visualizations in packages:
- Makes data more accessible
- Tells the story of your analysis
- Enables quick insights without downloading

### 5. Version Your Work

Quilt automatically versions packages:
- Each push creates a new version
- Previous versions remain accessible
- Use version hashes for reproducibility
