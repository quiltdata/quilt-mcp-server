"""MCP tools for Quilt data access.

This package contains all the MCP tool implementations organized by functionality:
- auth: Authentication and filesystem checks
- buckets: S3 bucket operations
- packages: Package browsing and search
- package_ops: Package creation, update, and deletion
- s3_package: S3-to-package creation functionality
- permissions: AWS permissions discovery and bucket recommendations
- unified_package: Simplified, intelligent package creation interface

These tools are pure functions that are registered by the tools module.

Example usage:
    from quilt_mcp.tools import auth, buckets, packages, package_ops

    # Use auth tools
    status = auth.auth_status()

    # Use bucket tools
    objects = buckets.bucket_objects_list("my-bucket")

    # Use package tools
    pkg_list = packages.packages_list()
