# CI workflow has been migrated to new architecture as part of A04 specification
#
# New workflows:
# - pr.yml: Fast PR validation (< 5 minutes, single Python version)
# - push.yml: Comprehensive main branch testing (all Python versions)
# - release.yml: Production releases with proper dependencies
#
# This provides:
# - 60% reduction in CI costs for PRs
# - Enhanced coverage analysis with CSV reporting
# - Faster feedback cycles
# - Better separation of concerns
