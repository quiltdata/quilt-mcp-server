      description: Detailed explanation of why this feature is needed
      placeholder: |
        As a bioinformatics researcher, I often need to find datasets that overlap with specific genomic regions. 
        Currently, I have to manually search through packages and check metadata, which is time-consuming and error-prone.

        ```python
        # Search for packages overlapping genomic region
        result = await mcp_client.call_tool("search_by_coordinates", {
            "coordinates": "chr1:1000000-2000000",
            "genome_build": "GRCh38",
            "overlap_threshold": 0.5
        })
        
        # Search with multiple regions
        result = await mcp_client.call_tool("unified_search", {
            "query": "RNA-seq data",
            "filters": {
                "genomic_regions": ["chr1:1000000-2000000", "chr2:5000000-6000000"]
            }

        This would support our genomics workflow where we need to find datasets 
        overlapping specific chromosomal regions for comparative analysis.
        
        Similar functionality exists in tools like:
        - UCSC Genome Browser
        - Ensembl Genome Browser
        - Galaxy Project
