# Packaging Tool Description Update (2025-10-03)

## Problem
The LLM wasn't understanding the `namespace/package-name` convention for Quilt packages, leading to repeated errors where it would try to create packages with names like `csvdata` instead of `demo-team/csvdata`.

## Root Cause
The packaging tool's docstring didn't prominently explain the naming convention at the tool level. The LLM would see the tool and not realize the critical naming requirement until after it failed.

## Solution

### 1. Enhanced Tool Docstring
Updated the main `packaging()` function docstring to include a **prominent warning** about the naming convention right at the top:

```python
def packaging(action: Optional[str] = None, params: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None, _context: Optional[NavigationContext] = None) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Unified package management operations.
    
    ⚠️  CRITICAL: Package names MUST use 'namespace/package-name' format:
        - REQUIRED: Both namespace AND package name separated by exactly one '/'
        - REQUIRED: Lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens, underscores only
        - NO uppercase letters allowed
        - Examples: 'demo-team/csv-data', 'myteam/dataset1', 'analytics/q1-reports'
        - WRONG: 'csvdata' (missing namespace), 'MyTeam/Data' (uppercase)
```

### 2. Updated Action Discovery Response
When an LLM queries the tool with `action=None` (to discover available actions), it now receives explicit naming rules:

```json
{
  "module": "packaging",
  "actions": ["browse", "create", "create_from_s3", "metadata_templates", "get_template"],
  "CRITICAL_NAMING_RULE": "Package names MUST be 'namespace/package-name' format (lowercase only). Example: 'demo-team/csv-data'",
  "naming_examples": {
    "valid": ["demo-team/csv-data", "myteam/dataset1", "analytics/q1-reports"],
    "invalid": ["csvdata (missing namespace)", "MyTeam/Data (uppercase not allowed)"]
  }
}
```

### 3. Early Validation at Wrapper Level
Added immediate validation in the wrapper function **before** calling the actual `package_create()` function:

```python
# Early validation with helpful error message
if name and "/" not in name:
    return {
        "success": False,
        "error": f"Invalid package name: '{name}'. Missing namespace separator '/'.",
        "CRITICAL": "Package names MUST be in 'namespace/package-name' format",
        "provided": name,
        "examples": {
            "valid": ["demo-team/csv-data", "myteam/dataset1", "analytics/reports"],
            "invalid": ["csvdata (missing namespace)", "MyTeam/Data (uppercase)"]
        },
        "correct_format": "namespace/package-name (both parts required, lowercase only)",
        "tip": f"Try: 'demo-team/{name}' or 'myteam/{name}'"
    }
```

### 4. Comprehensive Example in Docstring
Added a clear example showing the correct usage:

```python
Example create action:
    packaging(action="create", params={
        "name": "demo-team/csv-analysis",  # MUST have namespace/package-name
        "files": ["s3://bucket/file1.csv", "s3://bucket/file2.csv"],
        "description": "CSV analysis dataset"
    })
```

## Benefits

1. **Immediate Visibility**: The LLM sees the naming requirement as soon as it looks at the tool
2. **Multiple Touchpoints**: The requirement is reinforced in:
   - Tool docstring (first thing the LLM sees)
   - Action discovery response
   - Early validation with helpful suggestions
   - Individual function docstrings

3. **Helpful Error Messages**: If the LLM still gets it wrong, the error message:
   - Clearly explains what's wrong
   - Shows examples of valid names
   - Provides suggestions based on what was attempted (e.g., "Try: 'demo-team/csvdata'")

4. **Prevents Backend Errors**: By validating at the wrapper level, we catch errors early before making expensive backend calls

## Files Modified

- `src/quilt_mcp/tools/packaging.py`
  - Updated `packaging()` function docstring
  - Enhanced action discovery response
  - Added early validation in create action handler

## Testing

The LLM should now:
1. Immediately see the naming convention when it discovers the tool
2. Include proper namespace in package names from the start
3. Get helpful guidance if it makes a mistake

### Expected Behavior

**When LLM queries the tool**:
```
packaging(action=None)
→ Returns naming rules prominently
```

**When LLM tries invalid name**:
```
packaging(action="create", params={"name": "csvdata", "files": [...]})
→ Immediately returns helpful error with suggestions:
   "Try: 'demo-team/csvdata' or 'myteam/csvdata'"
```

**When LLM uses correct format**:
```
packaging(action="create", params={"name": "demo-team/csvdata", "files": [...]})
→ Package creation proceeds normally
```
