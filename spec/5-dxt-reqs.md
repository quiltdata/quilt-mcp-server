# DXT Requirements

## Goals

### Primary Goals

- **One-click installation** of Quilt MCP Server for Claude Desktop users
- **Eliminate setup friction** - no Python/AWS/Docker knowledge required
- **Self-contained package** with all dependencies bundled
- **Consistent user experience** across different machines and OS environments

### Secondary Goals

- **Maintain security** - same JWT authentication and secure practices
- **Version consistency** - align with existing git SHA versioning strategy
- **CI/CD integration** - automated .dxt generation in release pipeline
- **Multi-platform support** - Windows, macOS, Linux compatibility

## Key Questions

### Technical Architecture

1. **Dependency Bundling**: Should we bundle a full Python environment or rely on system Python?
2. **Authentication**: How do users configure AWS credentials and JWT tokens in a .dxt?
3. **Configuration**: What's the minimal config needed vs. what should have sensible defaults?
4. **Size Optimization**: How do we keep .dxt file size reasonable while including all dependencies?

### User Experience

1. **Setup Flow**: What's the step-by-step user journey after .dxt installation?
2. **Error Handling**: How do users troubleshoot authentication or connectivity issues?
3. **Updates**: How do users upgrade to new versions of the .dxt?
4. **Uninstallation**: How do users cleanly remove the extension?

### Security & Compliance

1. **Credential Storage**: Where and how should AWS credentials be stored securely?
2. **Network Access**: Should .dxt include local-only mode vs. full cloud access?
3. **Permissions**: What file system permissions does the .dxt need?
4. **Audit Trail**: How do we log access for compliance without compromising security?

### Integration & Maintenance

1. **Release Process**: How does .dxt generation fit into our existing 4-phase pipeline?
2. **Testing**: How do we validate .dxt functionality across different environments?
3. **Compatibility**: How do we handle MCP protocol updates and Claude Desktop changes?
4. **Documentation**: What user docs are needed beyond the .dxt itself?

### Business Considerations

1. **Target Users**: Who is the primary audience - developers, analysts, or general users?
2. **Support Model**: How do we handle user support requests for .dxt installations?
3. **Distribution**: GitHub releases, website download, or other channels?
4. **Metrics**: How do we track adoption and usage of .dxt vs. other deployment methods?

## Success Criteria

### Should Have

- ✅ Configuration UI for bucket/catalog settings
- ✅ Clear error messages for common setup issues
- ✅ Automated testing in CI for .dxt generation
- ✅ Documentation for end users

### Could Have

- ✅ Offline mode for cached data
- ✅ Advanced configuration options for power users
- ✅ Integration with other MCP servers
