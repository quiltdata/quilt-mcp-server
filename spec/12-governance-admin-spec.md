# Quilt MCP Governance and Administration Tools Specification

## Overview

This specification outlines the implementation of comprehensive governance and administration tools for the Quilt MCP server. These tools will provide secure access to Quilt's administrative capabilities including user management, role management, SSO configuration, and enhanced tabulator administration.

## Background

Based on the Quilt documentation at https://docs.quilt.bio/quilt-platform-administrator/admin-1 and analysis of the `quilt3.admin` Python API, Quilt provides several administrative capabilities:

### Available Admin APIs
1. **User Management** (`quilt3.admin.users`)
   - List, get, create, delete users
   - Set user properties (email, admin status, active status)
   - Reset passwords
   - Manage user roles

2. **Role Management** (`quilt3.admin.roles`)
   - List all available roles (managed and unmanaged)
   - Role assignment and management

3. **SSO Configuration** (`quilt3.admin.sso_config`)
   - Get and set SSO configuration
   - Manage authentication settings

4. **Enhanced Tabulator Management** (`quilt3.admin.tabulator`)
   - Advanced tabulator table operations
   - Open query configuration
   - Table management across buckets

## Current State Analysis

The MCP server already includes:
- Basic tabulator functionality in `app/quilt_mcp/tools/tabulator.py`
- Authentication tools in `app/quilt_mcp/tools/auth.py`
- Permission discovery in `app/quilt_mcp/tools/permissions.py`

Missing governance capabilities:
- User management tools
- Role management tools
- SSO configuration management
- Enhanced administrative controls

## Implementation Plan

### 1. New Module: `governance.py`

Create a new module `app/quilt_mcp/tools/governance.py` that provides:

#### User Management Functions
- `admin_users_list()` - List all users with detailed information
- `admin_user_get(name: str)` - Get specific user details
- `admin_user_create(name: str, email: str, role: str, extra_roles: List[str])` - Create new user
- `admin_user_delete(name: str)` - Delete user
- `admin_user_set_email(name: str, email: str)` - Update user email
- `admin_user_set_admin(name: str, admin: bool)` - Set admin status
- `admin_user_set_active(name: str, active: bool)` - Set active status
- `admin_user_reset_password(name: str)` - Reset user password
- `admin_user_set_role(name: str, role: str, extra_roles: List[str], append: bool)` - Manage user roles
- `admin_user_add_roles(name: str, roles: List[str])` - Add roles to user
- `admin_user_remove_roles(name: str, roles: List[str], fallback: str)` - Remove roles from user

#### Role Management Functions
- `admin_roles_list()` - List all available roles

#### SSO Configuration Functions
- `admin_sso_config_get()` - Get current SSO configuration
- `admin_sso_config_set(config: str)` - Set SSO configuration
- `admin_sso_config_remove()` - Remove SSO configuration

#### Enhanced Tabulator Functions (extending existing)
- `admin_tabulator_open_query_get()` - Get open query status
- `admin_tabulator_open_query_set(enabled: bool)` - Set open query status

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling and Security

#### Security Considerations
- All admin functions require proper authentication
- Implement role-based access control checks
- Sanitize all inputs to prevent injection attacks
- Log all administrative actions for audit trails

#### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error messages with actionable guidance
- Graceful degradation when admin privileges are insufficient
- Clear distinction between authentication and authorization errors

### 3. Integration with Existing Tools

#### Extend Authentication Module
Update `app/quilt_mcp/tools/auth.py` to include:
- Admin privilege detection in `auth_status()`
- Enhanced user information display
- Administrative capability reporting

#### Enhance Tabulator Module
Update `app/quilt_mcp/tools/tabulator.py` to include:
- Integration with new admin tabulator functions
- Enhanced permission checking
- Better error reporting for admin operations

### 4. Output Formatting

Following the user preference for table format outputs:
- User lists displayed in tabular format with key information
- Role information presented in structured tables
- SSO configuration displayed in readable format
- Administrative action results clearly formatted

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

#### Test File: `tests/test_governance.py`
- Test all user management functions
- Test role management functions  
- Test SSO configuration functions
- Test error handling and edge cases
- Mock `quilt3.admin` calls for isolated testing

#### Test File: `tests/test_governance_integration.py`
- Integration tests with real Quilt admin API (when available)
- Test authentication and authorization flows
- Test administrative workflows end-to-end
- Test error scenarios with real backend

### Test Categories

#### Authentication Tests
- Test admin privilege detection
- Test graceful handling of insufficient privileges
- Test authentication failure scenarios

#### User Management Tests
- Test user creation, modification, deletion
- Test role assignment and removal
- Test email updates and password resets
- Test user listing and filtering

#### Role Management Tests
- Test role listing and information retrieval
- Test role assignment workflows

#### SSO Configuration Tests
- Test SSO config retrieval and updates
- Test configuration validation
- Test removal of SSO configuration

#### Integration Tests
- Test governance tools with existing MCP functionality
- Test administrative workflows across multiple tools
- Test permission inheritance and role-based access

### Validation Strategy

#### Functional Validation
1. **Admin Privilege Validation**: Verify all admin functions properly check for administrative privileges
2. **Input Validation**: Ensure all inputs are properly sanitized and validated
3. **Output Consistency**: Verify all outputs follow the established formatting patterns
4. **Error Handling**: Test comprehensive error scenarios and recovery

#### Security Validation
1. **Access Control**: Verify role-based access control works correctly
2. **Audit Logging**: Ensure administrative actions are properly logged
3. **Input Sanitization**: Test against injection attacks and malformed inputs
4. **Authentication**: Verify proper authentication checks throughout
