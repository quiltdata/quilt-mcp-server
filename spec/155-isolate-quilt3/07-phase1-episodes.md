# Phase 1 Episodes: Authentication Status Implementation

## Overview

This document breaks down the Phase 1 design into atomic change units that can be implemented, tested, and committed independently. Each episode represents a single, testable change that maintains system integrity throughout development.

## Reference Documents

- **Phase Design**: [06-phase1-design.md](./06-phase1-design.md) - Technical architecture
- **Phase Definition**: [04-phases.md](./04-phases.md) - Phase 1 specifications
- **Specifications**: [03-specifications.md](./03-specifications.md) - Target architecture

## Episode Sequencing Strategy

Episodes are ordered to maintain working state throughout implementation:

1. **Foundation First**: Build base classes and frameworks
2. **Layer by Layer**: Complete each architectural layer before dependencies
3. **Test-Driven**: Each episode includes comprehensive BDD tests
4. **Integration Last**: End-to-end integration after all components work

## Episode Implementation Guidelines

### TDD Requirements

Each episode MUST follow strict Test-Driven Development:

1. **Red Phase**: Write comprehensive failing tests first
   - Test all success scenarios
   - Test all error conditions
   - Test boundary conditions and edge cases
   - Commit failing tests before implementation

2. **Green Phase**: Implement minimum code to pass tests
   - Focus on making tests pass, not on perfect implementation
   - Avoid over-engineering during green phase
   - Commit working implementation

3. **Refactor Phase**: Improve code quality while keeping tests green
   - Optimize performance and readability
   - Remove duplication and improve abstractions
   - Commit refactored code separately

### Quality Standards

- **Test Coverage**: 100% line and branch coverage for all new code
- **Type Safety**: Full type annotations with mypy validation
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive docstrings for all public interfaces
- **Error Messages**: Clear, actionable error messages for all failure modes

### Validation Commands

After each episode:

```bash
# Test the specific episode
make test tests/test_<module>.py

# Verify full test suite still passes
make test

# Check code quality
make lint

# Validate types
mypy src/

# Check coverage
make coverage
```

### Episode Dependencies

Episodes must be implemented in order due to dependencies:

- Episodes 1-3: Foundation layers (can be parallel if resources allow)
- Episode 4: Depends on Episodes 2-3
- Episode 6: Depends on Episodes 4-5
- Episode 7: Depends on Episodes 2,6
- Episode 8: Depends on Episode 7

### Success Criteria

Each episode is complete when:

1. All tests pass (including existing tests)
2. Code coverage meets 100% requirement
3. Type checking passes without errors
4. Linting passes without violations
5. Episode functionality works as designed
6. Integration with previous episodes is validated

## Risk Management

### Episode Failure Recovery

If an episode fails:

1. Revert to the last working commit
2. Analyze failure root cause
3. Adjust episode scope if needed
4. Restart episode with lessons learned

### Integration Risks

- **Configuration Loading**: Test multiple configuration sources thoroughly
- **Error Propagation**: Ensure errors bubble up correctly through all layers
- **State Isolation**: Verify no global state dependencies are introduced
- **Performance Impact**: Monitor authentication operation performance

### Quality Assurance

- Each episode includes comprehensive error scenario testing
- Integration points are validated with both success and failure cases
- MCP Inspector compatibility is verified at episode boundaries
- Performance regression testing for each architectural layer

## Next Phase Preparation

Successful completion of these episodes establishes:

- Reusable configuration and operation patterns
- Proven isolation architecture
- Comprehensive testing frameworks
- MCP integration best practices

These patterns will be extended in Phase 2 for package listing operations with minimal architectural changes.
