# Implementation Phases - Tracer Bullet Approach

## Overview

This document outlines a tracer bullet implementation strategy where each phase delivers one complete Quilt3 feature working end-to-end through the full isolation pattern. Each phase proves the isolation works for that specific feature before moving to the next.

### Tracer Bullet Philosophy

Instead of building horizontal layers (all config, then all API, then all adapters), we implement complete vertical slices:

- Phase = One complete feature working from configuration → API → MCP adapter → operation
- Each phase delivers a testable, working feature
- Risk is managed by feature complexity, not architectural scope
- Pattern validation happens incrementally with each feature

## Phase 1: Authentication Status (Tracer Bullet)

**Goal**: Establish the complete isolation pattern with the simplest, safest feature

**Feature**: `auth_status` - Check authentication status for a Quilt3 instance

**Why This Feature**:

- Read-only operation (safest)
- No parameters required
- Clear success/failure states
- Essential for all other operations

**Deliverables**:

1. **Configuration System** (`src/quilt_mcp/config/`)
   - `quilt3.py`: Isolated Quilt3 configuration class
   - Simple configuration loading and validation

2. **Operation Implementation** (`src/quilt_mcp/operations/quilt3/`)
   - `auth.py`: Complete rewrite with isolation
   - Authentication status check
   - Proper error handling and response formatting

3. **MCP API Integration** (`src/quilt_mcp/api/`)
   - `quilt3.py`: MCP tool definitions for auth operations
   - Response standardization

4. **Core Adapter** (`src/quilt_mcp/`)
   - `server.py`: Tool registration and routing
   - Configuration loading and management

5. **Test Suite**:
   - Configuration isolation tests
   - Auth operation unit tests
   - End-to-end MCP integration tests

**Success Criteria**:

- Users can configure Quilt3 connection
- `auth_status` works with isolated configuration
- Full test coverage for the complete stack
- MCP Inspector shows working tool

**Validation Commands**:

```bash
# Test configuration isolation
make test tests/test_config_quilt3.py

# Test auth operation
make test tests/test_operations_quilt3_auth.py

# Test full integration
make test tests/test_integration_quilt3.py

# Manual validation via MCP Inspector
make run-inspector
```

## Phase 2: Package Listing

**Goal**: Add read-only data operations to prove pattern scales

**Feature**: `list_packages` - List packages in a Quilt3 registry

**Why This Feature**:

- Read-only (safe)
- Returns structured data
- Builds on Phase 1 auth foundation

**Deliverables**:

1. **Operation Extension**:
   - `catalog.py`: Isolated package listing
   - Parameter validation

2. **MCP API Extension**:
   - New tool definition for package listing

3. **Testing**:
   - Package listing operation tests

**Success Criteria**:

- Package listing works with isolated configuration

## Phase 3: Package Information

**Goal**: Add detailed data retrieval operations

**Feature**: `get_package_info` - Get detailed information about a specific package

**Why This Feature**:

- Still read-only (safe)
- Returns detailed package data

**Deliverables**:

1. **Operation Extension**:
   - Enhanced `catalog.py` with package detail retrieval

2. **MCP API Extension**:
   - Package info tool definition

3. **Testing**:
   - Package detail operation tests

**Success Criteria**:

- Package info retrieval works with isolated configuration

## Phase 4: File Operations

**Goal**: Add file system operations with proper safety

**Feature**: `browse_package` - Browse files within a package

**Why This Feature**:

- File system interaction
- Read-only operation

**Deliverables**:

1. **New Operation Module**:
   - `files.py`: Package file browsing

2. **MCP API Extension**:
   - File browsing tool definition

**Success Criteria**:

- File browsing works with isolated configuration

## Phase 5: Package Installation

**Goal**: Add write operations

**Feature**: `install_package` - Install a package to local system

**Why This Feature**:

- Write operation
- High-value user functionality

**Deliverables**:

1. **Operation Extension**:
   - `catalog.py`: Package installation

**Success Criteria**:

- Package installation works with isolated configuration

## Phase 6: Data Upload

**Goal**: Complete the operations with data upload

**Feature**: `push_package` - Upload/update a package

**Why This Feature**:

- Upload operation
- Completes the feature set

**Deliverables**:

1. **Operation Extension**:
   - Upload operations with isolation

**Success Criteria**:

- Package upload works with isolated configuration

## Implementation Guidelines

### Per-Phase Process

1. **Setup**:
   - Create feature branch: `impl/quilt3-phase-N-<feature>`
   - Review Phase N-1 integration
   - Plan minimal viable implementation

2. **Development** (TDD Required):
   - Write failing tests for the complete vertical slice
   - Implement configuration changes
   - Implement operation logic
   - Implement MCP API integration
   - Implement core adapter changes

3. **Validation**:
   - Run full test suite
   - Manual testing via MCP Inspector
   - Performance validation
   - Security review (Phases 4+)

4. **Integration**:
   - Update documentation
   - Create PR with complete feature
   - Merge to main branch

### Cross-Phase Consistency

- **Configuration**: Each phase may extend the configuration schema
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error formats across all operations
- **Response Format**: Standardized response structure
- **Testing**: Cumulative test coverage across all implemented features
- **Documentation**: Updated per phase with working examples

### Risk Management

- **Phase 1-3**: Low risk (read-only operations)
- **Phase 4**: Medium risk (file system access)
- **Phase 5-6**: High risk (write operations)

Each phase validates the isolation pattern works before increasing complexity/risk.

## Success Metrics

### Phase Completion Criteria

Each phase must demonstrate:

1. **Functionality**: Feature works as specified
2. **Isolation**: Configuration and operations work independently
3. **Testing**: 100% test coverage for new code
4. **Integration**: MCP Inspector shows working tools
5. **Documentation**: Updated with working examples

### Overall Success

By Phase 6 completion:

- All major Quilt3 operations supported
- Configuration isolation proven
- Complete test coverage achieved
- Production-ready isolation pattern established
- Clear path for future feature additions

## Rollback Strategy

If any phase fails validation:

1. Revert to previous phase's working state
2. Analyze failure root cause
3. Adjust implementation approach
4. Restart failed phase with lessons learned

The tracer bullet approach ensures we always have a working baseline to return to.
