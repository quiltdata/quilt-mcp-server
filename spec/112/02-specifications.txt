**Issue**: [#112 - IRS/DSCO](https://github.com/quiltdata/quilt-mcp-server/issues/112)  
**Based on**: [01-requirements.txt](./01-requirements.txt)
**Type**: Process Documentation Specification
**Priority**: Medium

## Process Specification: IRS/DSCO Methodology

### Core Methodology Definition

The IRS/DSCO methodology represents a structured, phase-based approach to complex software development that emphasizes systematic problem breakdown, comprehensive validation, and clear documentation throughout the development lifecycle.

**Acronym Breakdown**:
1. **I**ssue - Problem identification and tracking
2. **R**equirements - User expectations and acceptance criteria
3. **S**pecifications - Engineering goals and constraints  
4. **/** - Division marker separating analysis from implementation
5. **D**esign - Phase-specific technical design documents
6. **S**tage - Implementation staging and execution
7. **C**checklist - Validation and testing procedures
8. **O**rchestrator - Process coordination and management

### Document Structure Pattern

Based on analysis of spec/100 reference implementation, the IRS/DSCO methodology follows this document pattern:

#### Analysis Phase (IRS)
1. **01-requirements.{md|txt}** - Problem statement, user stories, acceptance criteria
2. **02-specifications.{md|txt}** - Engineering goals, constraints, success metrics (WITHOUT implementation details)

#### Implementation Phase (DSCO)  
3. **03-phase{N}-design.{md|txt}** - Technical design for specific implementation phase
4. **04-phase{N}-checklist.{md|txt}** - Validation procedures and implementation tracking
5. **{N}-phase{N}-progress.{md|txt}** - Progress tracking and status updates (as needed)
6. **{N}-review.{md|txt}** - Phase completion analysis and lessons learned
7. **{N}-improvements.{md|txt}** - Identified improvements and future considerations
8. **{N}-final-checklist.{md|txt}** - Complete validation checklist
9. **{N}-release.{md|txt}** - Release documentation and deployment record

### File Organization Principles

#### Numbering Convention
- **Sequential numbering** (01, 02, 03...) for chronological phases
- **Descriptive names** indicating phase and document type
- **Consistent extensions** (.md for structured docs, .txt for simple text)

#### Directory Structure
```

```

### Phase Workflow Specification

#### Analysis Phase
- **Issue Identification**: Document problem scope, stakeholders, business impact
- **Requirements Gathering**: Define user expectations, acceptance criteria, success metrics
- **Specification Writing**: Engineering constraints, technical goals, validation criteria
- **Specification Review**: Ensure completeness before implementation begins

#### Implementation Phase  
- **Design Documentation**: Technical approach, architecture decisions, implementation strategy
- **Staged Implementation**: Break complex features into manageable phases
- **Validation Checklists**: Comprehensive testing and quality assurance procedures
- **Progress Tracking**: Regular status updates and milestone verification
- **Process Coordination**: Orchestrate workflow stages and manage dependencies

### Document Content Specifications

#### Requirements Document (01)
**Must Include**:
- Problem statement with business context
- User story format: "As a [role], I want [functionality] so that [benefit]"
- Acceptance criteria (numbered list)
- Implementation approach (high-level only)
- Success criteria (measurable outcomes)

#### Specifications Document (02)
**Must Include**:
- Current state analysis with quantitative metrics
- Proposed target state with specific measurable goals
- Implementation plan broken into phases
- Success metrics (quantitative and qualitative)
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- Dependencies and external requirements

**Must NOT Include**:
- Actual implementation code
- Detailed implementation procedures
- Technology-specific implementation details

#### Design Documents (03, 05, 07...)
**Must Include**:
- Phase-specific technical design
- Architecture decisions and rationale
- Implementation strategy for that phase
- Integration points with other phases
- Technology choices and justification

#### Checklist Documents (04, 06, 08...)
**Must Include**:
- Granular implementation tasks with status tracking
- Validation procedures for each task
- Testing requirements and success criteria
- Quality gates and milestone verification
- Issue tracking and resolution status

### Documentation Standards

#### Writing Guidelines
- **Clear and actionable language** - avoid ambiguous terms
- **Numbered lists** for acceptance criteria and success metrics
- **Consistent formatting** across all documents
- **Quantitative metrics** where possible (percentages, counts, timelines)
- **Reference links** between related documents

#### Version Control
- Documents are **historical records** - do not update after completion
- Each document represents the state of knowledge at time of creation
- Create new documents for iterations rather than updating existing ones
- Use git commits to track document evolution

### Process Coordination

#### Human Developer Usage
- Follow documents sequentially for systematic approach
- Use checklists to track progress and ensure completeness
- Reference specifications to validate implementation decisions
- Review completed phases to inform future work

#### AI Agent Usage  
- spec/AGENTS.md should be symbolically linked to CLAUDE.md for accessibility
- AI agents should reference methodology for structured problem-solving
- Use TodoWrite tool to track progress through workflow phases
- Follow same document patterns for consistency

### Integration with Development Workflow

#### Branch Strategy
- **Specification branches**: `spec/{issue-number}` for analysis phase
- **Implementation branches**: `impl/{feature-name}` for development phase
- Merge specification work before beginning implementation

#### Testing Requirements
- **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)** testing throughout implementation
- **Integration tests** for complex multi-phase features  
- **Test coverage requirements** defined in specifications
- **Validation procedures** documented in checklists

### Success Criteria for IRS/DSCO Implementation

#### Process Documentation
- Complete specification of IRS/DSCO methodology
- Clear phase definitions and document templates
- Integration with existing development workflow
- Reference implementation available in spec/100

#### Usability Requirements
- **Human accessible** - developers can follow methodology independently
- **AI accessible** - AI agents can reference and apply methodology
- **Minimal and concise** - easy to scan and understand quickly
- **Actionable prompts** - clear triggers for each phase

#### Quality Standards
- **Systematic approach** to complex problem breakdown
- **Comprehensive validation** at each development stage
- **Clear documentation** and progress tracking
- **Template consistency** for future feature development

## Dependencies and Constraints

### External Dependencies
- GitHub issue tracking for problem identification
- Git version control for document evolution
- Existing development tools and workflow integration

### Internal Dependencies  
- CLAUDE.md symbolic link for AI agent accessibility
- WORKFLOW.md integration for branch strategy
- TodoWrite tool usage for progress tracking
- BDD testing framework for validation

### Process Constraints
- Documents must be created in sequential order
- Specifications must be complete before implementation begins
- Each phase requires validation before proceeding to next phase
- Historical documents should not be modified after completion

## Notes

This specification defines the **what** and **structure** of the IRS/DSCO methodology without prescribing specific implementation tools or technologies. The methodology is designed to be technology-agnostic while providing sufficient structure for both human developers and AI agents to follow systematically.

Reference implementation available in spec/100 demonstrates practical application of this methodology for repository cleanup and makefile consolidation project.
