# Requirements: IRS Data Scraping and Configuration (IRSDSCO)

**Issue**: [#112 - IRS/DSCO](https://github.com/quiltdata/quilt-mcp-server/issues/112)  
**Type**: Process Documentation  
**Priority**: Medium

## Problem Statement

The development process used in spec/100 needs to be documented and systematized for reuse by both humans and AI systems. The IRS/DSCO acronym represents a structured workflow:

1. **I**ssue - Problem identification and tracking
2. **R**equirements - User expectations and acceptance criteria, from the issue
3. **S**pecifications - Engineering goals and constraints, relative to this repo
   1. Do NOT include implementation details
4. **/** - Division into implementation phases
5. **D**esign - Phase-specific design documents
6. **S**tage - Implementation staging and execution
7. **C**hecklist - Validation and testing procedures
8. **O**rchestrator - Process coordination and management

## User Story

As a developer (human or AI), I want a documented, repeatable process for complex feature development so that I can systematically approach multi-phase implementations with clear milestones and validation checkpoints.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Process Documentation** - Create spec/AGENTS.md documenting the IRS/DSCO workflow
2. **Symbolic Link** - Link spec/AGENTS.md to CLAUDE.md for AI accessibility
3. **Reference Prompts** - Provide clear prompts to trigger each phase of the process
4. **Reference Implementation** - Use spec/100 as the exemplar implementation
5. **Human and AI Usability** - Documentation must be accessible to both human developers and AI agents
6. **Minimal and Concise** - Documentation must be easy to scan and understand

## Implementation Approach

1. Analyze the spec/100 directory structure and file organization
2. Extract the process patterns and workflow stages
3. Document the IRS/DSCO methodology with clear phase definitions
4. Create spec/AGENTS.md with the documented process
5. Establish symbolic link from spec/AGENTS.md to CLAUDE.md
6. Validate the documentation against the spec/100 reference implementation

## Success Criteria

- Clear, actionable documentation of the IRS/DSCO process
- Symbolic link established for AI agent access
- Process can be followed by both human and AI developers
- Documentation serves as a template for future complex feature development
- Maintains consistency with existing spec/100 implementation patterns

## Notes

The IRS/DSCO process represents a structured approach to complex software development that emphasizes:
- Systematic problem breakdown
- Phase-based implementation
- Comprehensive validation at each stage
- Clear documentation and tracking throughout the lifecycle
