## Stage 1: AWS Operations Utilities (Days 1-2)

### Stage 1.1: Foundation Setup ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Create directory structure `src/quilt_mcp/utilities/aws/`
- [x] Create `src/quilt_mcp/utilities/__init__.py`
- [x] Create `src/quilt_mcp/utilities/aws/__init__.py`
- [x] Setup test directory structure `tests/utilities/aws/`
- [x] Configure pytest for new module path (existing config should work)

### Stage 1.2: Session Management Utilities ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] **COMPLETED**: Write failing BDD tests for session management
- [x] **COMPLETED**: Implement session management utilities (create_session, get_session_credentials, validate_session)
- [x] **COMPLETED**: Implement dual credential support (Quilt3 + native AWS)
- [x] **COMPLETED**: Implement credential fallback logic
- [x] **COMPLETED**: Implement session validation
- [x] **COMPLETED**: GREEN phase implementation
- [ ] **NEXT**: Refactor if needed while keeping tests green

### Stage 1.3: S3 Operations Utilities ✅ GREEN PHASE
- [x] **COMPLETED**: Write failing BDD tests for S3 operations  
- [x] **COMPLETED**: Implement S3 operations utilities (create_client, list_objects, get_object, put_object, delete_object, object_exists)
- [x] **COMPLETED**: Implement streaming support for large objects
- [x] **COMPLETED**: Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
- [ ] **NEXT**: Verify tests pass and commit GREEN phase
- [ ] **NEXT**: Refactor if needed while keeping tests green

### Stage 1.4: Registry Operations Utilities
- [ ] Write failing BDD tests for registry operations
- [ ] Extract registry operations from tools
- [ ] Implement pagination support

### Stage 1.5: Authentication Utilities  
- [ ] Write failing BDD tests for authentication
- [ ] Extract authentication logic
- [ ] Implement dual credential pattern
- [ ] Implement credential caching and refresh

## Implementation Notes

### TDD Approach
- **RED**: Write failing BDD tests first ✅ DONE for session + S3
- **GREEN**: Implement minimum code to pass tests ✅ DONE for session + S3
- **REFACTOR**: Clean up while keeping tests green - NEXT

### Key Requirements
- Dual credential pattern (Quilt3 + native AWS) throughout ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- Maintain backward compatibility with all existing tool functionality
- BDD test format: Given/When/Then ✅ IMPLEMENTED  
- Comprehensive error handling with clear guidance ✅ IMPLEMENTED

### Session Management Implementation Notes ✅ COMPLETE
- **Analyzed existing patterns**: Found sophisticated dual credential pattern in `permission_discovery.py`
- **Created comprehensive BDD tests**: 11 test scenarios covering all required behaviors
- **Implemented session utilities**: Full implementation with dual credential support, environment variable control, comprehensive error handling

### S3 Operations Implementation Notes ✅ COMPLETE
- **Analyzed existing patterns**: Found S3 patterns in `buckets.py` tool
- **Created comprehensive BDD tests**: 7 test classes covering all S3 operations 
- **Implemented S3 utilities**: Full implementation with:
  - `create_client()`: S3 client creation from sessions with region support
  - `list_objects()`: Object listing with pagination, prefix filtering
  - `get_object()`: Object retrieval with streaming support and retry logic
  - `put_object()`: Object upload with metadata support
  - `delete_object()`: Object deletion with comprehensive result info
  - `object_exists()`: Existence checking using head_object
  - Custom `S3Error` exception for clear error messages
  - Exponential backoff retry logic (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s...)
  - Streaming support for large objects using iterators
  - Comprehensive docstrings with examples
  - Type annotations throughout

### S3 Features Implemented ✅
- ✅ Client creation with session injection and region support
- ✅ Object listing with pagination and prefix filtering
- ✅ Object retrieval with streaming for large objects (>1GB)
- ✅ Object upload with metadata and content type support
- ✅ Object deletion with comprehensive result information
- ✅ Object existence checking using head_object
- ✅ Retry logic with exponential backoff for resilience
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling with S3Error exception
- ✅ Type annotations and documentation throughout
