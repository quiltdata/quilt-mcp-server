test: Add BDD tests for session management utilities

- Create comprehensive BDD tests for AWS session management
- Test dual credential pattern (Quilt3 + native AWS)
- Test credential fallback logic and environment variable controls
- Test session validation and credential extraction
- All tests designed to fail initially (TDD RED phase)
- Tests cover scenarios defined in Phase 1 checklist

Tests follow Given/When/Then BDD format and test behavior, not implementation.
Implementation will follow to make tests pass (GREEN phase).
