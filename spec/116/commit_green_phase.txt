feat: implement session management utilities (green phase)

- Implement create_session() with dual credential support (Quilt3 + native AWS)
- Add credential fallback logic: Quilt3 → native AWS → error with guidance
- Support environment variable control (QUILT_DISABLE_QUILT3_SESSION)
- Add AWS profile support for native sessions
- Implement get_session_credentials() for safe credential extraction
- Implement validate_session() using STS get_caller_identity
- Add comprehensive error handling with actionable guidance
- Include type annotations, docstrings, and examples throughout
- Support region specification and mock detection for testing

Implementation makes all BDD tests pass while following existing patterns
from permission_discovery.py. Features comprehensive logging and SessionError
exception for clear error messages.
