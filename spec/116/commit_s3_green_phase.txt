feat: implement S3 operations utilities (green phase)

- Implement create_client() for S3 client creation with session injection
- Add list_objects() with pagination and prefix filtering support
- Implement get_object() with streaming support and retry logic
- Add put_object() with metadata and content type support
- Implement delete_object() with comprehensive result information
- Add object_exists() using head_object for existence checking
- Include exponential backoff retry logic (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s...)
- Support streaming for large objects using iterators
- Add comprehensive error handling with S3Error exception
- Include type annotations, docstrings, and examples throughout

Implementation extracts and refactors patterns from existing buckets.py
tool while making all BDD tests pass. Features dependency injection
for testability and consistent error handling patterns.
