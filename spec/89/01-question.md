# Issue #89: DXT Extension Module Import Failure

## Problem Statement

The Quilt MCP server DXT extension (version 0.5.6) fails to start due to a critical module import error. Claude cannot establish connection to the Quilt MCP server, rendering all Quilt data operations through MCP non-functional.

## Error Details

- **Error Type**: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'quilt_mcp'`
- **Version**: quilt-mcp-0.5.6.dxt
- **Environment**: Python 3.13 on macOS
- **Location**: DXT extension in Claude's local extensions directory
- **Severity**: High - Complete MCP server functionality unavailable

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue stems from the DXT extension's inability to locate and import the `quilt_mcp` module during server initialization. This suggests one or more of the following problems:

1. **Incomplete Package Installation**: The `quilt_mcp` package may not be properly installed in the DXT virtual environment
2. **Python Path Configuration**: Incorrect PYTHONPATH or module search path configuration
3. **Dependency Resolution**: Missing or incorrectly installed dependencies
4. **Package Build Issues**: Improper package structure or build process for DXT context

## Impact Assessment

- **Immediate**: Claude cannot connect to Quilt MCP server
- **Functional**: All Quilt data operations through MCP are blocked
- **User Experience**: Complete loss of Quilt integration functionality
- **Persistence**: Error occurs consistently across connection attempts and reinstallations

## Investigation Requirements

To resolve this issue, we need to:

1. Verify the `quilt_mcp` package installation status in the DXT environment
2. Check virtual environment configuration and activation
3. Review the dependency installation process and requirements
4. Validate module path and import mechanisms
5. Examine the DXT extension build and packaging process

## Success Criteria

The issue will be resolved when:
- The DXT extension successfully imports the `quilt_mcp` module
- Claude can establish connection to the Quilt MCP server
- All Quilt MCP functionality becomes available through the DXT extension
- The solution is stable across different Python environments and versions
