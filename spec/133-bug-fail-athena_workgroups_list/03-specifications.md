# System Specifications: Enhanced Athena Workgroups Listing

**Issue #133**  
**Branch:** `133-bug-fail-athena_workgroups_list`  
**Specification Date:** 2025-09-10

## Overview

This specification defines the optimized behavior for the `athena_workgroups_list` MCP tool to provide clean workgroup information using AWS terminology and minimal API calls. The system shall use `ListWorkGroups` as the primary data source and optionally enhance with `GetWorkGroup` details when permissions allow.

## Functional Requirements

### FR1: Usable Workgroup Discovery

**Requirement:** The system shall discover and return only ENABLED workgroups that users can actually use for queries.

**Filtering Strategy:**

- Retrieve all workgroups using `ListWorkGroups` API
- Filter to only workgroups with `State == "ENABLED"`
- Extract Name, Description (when AWS provides it) for ENABLED workgroups

**Optional Enhancement (GetWorkGroup):**

- Attempt `GetWorkGroup` for each ENABLED workgroup to retrieve additional details
- On success: Include CreationTime, Configuration details
- On failure: Use only basic information from `ListWorkGroups`

**Success Criteria:**

- Only ENABLED workgroups included in results
- All returned workgroups are usable for queries
- Additional details included when `GetWorkGroup` succeeds
- No unusable or synthetic information presented to users

### FR2: Clean Information Structure

**Requirement:** The system shall present workgroup information using AWS field names and values without synthetic additions.

**Information Structure:**

- Use AWS field names directly: `Name`, `Description`
- Omit State field since all returned workgroups are ENABLED
- Add configuration details when available from `GetWorkGroup`
- Omit fields when information is not available rather than using placeholder values

**Success Criteria:**

- Field names match AWS API response structure
- Description field contains AWS-provided description or is omitted
- No redundant State information since all results are ENABLED
- No error messages or synthetic status information in data fields

### FR3: AWS API Data Fidelity

**Requirement:** The system shall preserve AWS API response data without modification or synthetic additions.

**Data Preservation:**

- `ListWorkGroups` response data used for filtering and basic information
- `GetWorkGroup` response data merged when available
- No modification of AWS-provided values
- Field presence indicates data availability

**Success Criteria:**

- AWS Description values used when provided
- AWS Configuration data included when `GetWorkGroup` succeeds
- No synthetic fields added beyond AWS API responses
- Filtering based on AWS State without exposing redundant information

### FR4: Optional Detail Enhancement

**Requirement:** The system shall attempt to retrieve additional workgroup details without impacting core functionality when retrieval fails.

**Enhancement Behavior:**

- `GetWorkGroup` failures are expected and acceptable
- Core workgroup listing succeeds with `ListWorkGroups` data only
- Additional fields included only when `GetWorkGroup` succeeds
- No retry logic for permission errors (expected failures)

**Success Criteria:**

- Tool completes successfully with any level of AWS permissions
- `GetWorkGroup` failures do not affect output quality
- Enhanced details appear when permissions allow
- Diagnostic logging for troubleshooting without user-facing errors

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR1: Simplified Output Structure

**Requirement:** The system shall provide clean, minimal output structure using AWS terminology.

**Output Structure:**

- Use AWS field names and values directly
- Include fields only when data is available
- Eliminate synthetic status fields
- Provide summary count of total workgroups

**Success Criteria:**

- Output structure reflects AWS API responses
- No artificial fields beyond AWS data
- Field presence indicates data availability

### NFR2: Performance Optimization

**Requirement:** The system shall improve performance by reducing unnecessary API calls while maintaining information quality.

**Optimization Strategy:**

- Maximize information extraction from `ListWorkGroups` API call (single required call)
- Use `GetWorkGroup` calls only for enhanced details, not basic workgroup information
- Fail fast on permission errors to avoid retry overhead on expected failures
- Maintain current parallel processing approach for enhanced detail retrieval

**Success Criteria:**

- Reduced API call volume for environments with limited permissions
- Response times improve for permission-restricted scenarios
- Memory usage remains consistent with current implementation
- Enhanced detail retrieval performance unchanged for accessible workgroups

### NFR3: Authentication Method Support

**Requirement:** The system shall work with both Quilt3 and default AWS authentication methods.

**Authentication Support:**

- Quilt3 authentication with assumed roles
- Default AWS credential chain authentication
- Consistent AWS API access patterns for both methods

**Success Criteria:**

- Both authentication methods produce identical output structure
- AWS API responses processed consistently regardless of credential source
- Regional configuration handled appropriately for each authentication method

## Quality Requirements

### QR1: User Experience Standards

**Requirement:** The system shall provide clear, actionable information to users about workgroup accessibility.

**Measurable Outcomes:**

- Zero raw AWS exception messages in user-facing fields
- Consistent status messaging format across all restricted workgroups
- Clear indication of next steps for users with limited permissions

**Validation Criteria:**

- Manual review of output confirms clean, professional presentation
- User testing confirms improved readability and comprehension
- Documentation accurately reflects expected behavior

### QR2: Diagnostic Capability

**Requirement:** The system shall maintain detailed diagnostic information for troubleshooting while improving user experience.

**Diagnostic Features:**

- Preserve error context in logging system
- Maintain debug-level information for AWS API failures
- Enable troubleshooting of permission and configuration issues

**Validation Criteria:**

- Log files contain sufficient detail for debugging AWS permission issues
- Debug information does not leak into user-facing responses
- Support personnel can diagnose issues using available log data

### QR3: Error Recovery and Resilience

**Requirement:** The system shall continue to provide useful information even when most workgroups are inaccessible.

**Resilience Patterns:**

- Partial failures do not prevent successful workgroup information from being returned
- Single workgroup access failures do not affect other workgroups
- System gracefully handles scenarios where zero workgroups are accessible

**Validation Criteria:**

- Tool provides value even with minimal AWS permissions
- Partial success scenarios return meaningful results
- Error conditions do not prevent tool completion

## Integration Requirements

### IR1: MCP Tool Interface

**Requirement:** The system shall provide a clean MCP tool interface for workgroup listing.

**Interface Specification:**

- Function: `athena_workgroups_list(use_quilt_auth: bool = True) -> Dict[str, Any]`
- Success response with workgroups array and summary information
- Error response for service-level failures only
- Optional formatting enhancement for display

**Validation Criteria:**

- Tool registration works through MCP framework
- Response structure contains workgroups and metadata
- Service-level errors handled appropriately

### IR2: AWS Service Integration

**Requirement:** The system shall integrate efficiently with AWS Athena service APIs using a layered access approach.

**AWS API Usage Pattern:**

- `ListWorkGroups`: Required baseline API call (must succeed for tool functionality)
  - Extracts: Name, State, Description (when provided)
  - Minimum permission: `athena:ListWorkGroups`
- `GetWorkGroup`: Enhancement API call (failure acceptable)
  - Extracts: CreationTime, OutputLocation, Configuration details
  - Additional permission: `athena:GetWorkGroup` (per workgroup)
- Error handling optimized for enterprise security policies expecting limited permissions

**Validation Criteria:**

- Provides meaningful results with only `athena:ListWorkGroups` permission
- Enhances information quality when additional permissions available
- Respects AWS API rate limits and implements appropriate retry logic
- No functional degradation when `GetWorkGroup` permissions unavailable

### IR3: Logging and Monitoring Integration

**Requirement:** The system shall integrate with existing logging and monitoring infrastructure.

**Logging Requirements:**

- Error-level logging for service failures that prevent tool completion
- Debug-level logging for individual workgroup access failures
- Info-level logging for successful operations and summary statistics

**Validation Criteria:**

- Log messages follow established patterns and formatting
- Appropriate log levels used for different types of events
- Sensitive information (credentials, detailed error messages) not logged inappropriately

## Security and Compliance Requirements

### SR1: Credential Handling

**Requirement:** The system shall maintain secure credential handling patterns established in the codebase.

**Security Patterns:**

- No credential information in error messages or user-facing responses
- Secure handling of both Quilt3 and AWS credential sources
- No credential leakage in logging or diagnostic output

**Validation Criteria:**

- Security review confirms no credential exposure in any code path
- Error messages do not contain authentication details
- Logging output does not include sensitive credential information

### SR2: Error Information Exposure

**Requirement:** The system shall limit exposure of sensitive system information while maintaining diagnostic capability.

**Information Security:**

- AWS account numbers, role names, and detailed permission structures should not be exposed
- Error messages should be generic enough to avoid information disclosure
- Debug information should be available through logging without user exposure

**Validation Criteria:**

- User-facing error messages do not reveal sensitive system details
- Diagnostic information is available through appropriate channels
- No information leakage that could assist unauthorized access attempts

## API Optimization Strategy

### Current vs Optimized Approach

**Current Implementation Issues:**

- Returns DISABLED workgroups that users cannot use
- Includes redundant State field when all results should be ENABLED
- Pollutes Description field with exception messages instead of using AWS-provided descriptions
- Creates synthetic `accessible` status fields not present in AWS APIs
- Treats permission limitations as errors rather than expected behavior

**Optimized Implementation:**

```json
// Information from ListWorkGroups (minimal permissions)
{
  "Name": "workgroup-name",
  "Description": "Purpose description"
}

// Enhanced Information (when GetWorkGroup succeeds)
{
  "Name": "workgroup-name",
  "Description": "Purpose description",
  "CreationTime": "2023-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "Configuration": {
    "ResultConfiguration": {
      "OutputLocation": "s3://bucket/results/"
    },
    "EnforceWorkGroupConfiguration": true
  }
}
```

### Performance and Permission Benefits

1. **Minimal API Usage:** Core functionality uses single `ListWorkGroups` call
2. **AWS Data Preservation:** Direct use of AWS-provided field names and values
3. **Permission Independence:** Useful output regardless of `GetWorkGroup` access
4. **Clean Presentation:** No synthetic fields or error message pollution

## Technical Uncertainties and Risks

### Risk 1: ListWorkGroups Data Completeness Variability

**Uncertainty:** Different AWS accounts may provide varying levels of detail in `ListWorkGroups` response (e.g., description field may be empty).

**Risk Assessment:** Low - `ListWorkGroups` consistently provides Name and State; Description variability is manageable

**Mitigation Strategy:** Design information presentation to handle optional fields gracefully and provide clear indicators when information is unavailable

### Risk 2: AWS API Changes

**Uncertainty:** Future AWS API changes could affect the workgroup discovery and access patterns.

**Risk Assessment:** Low - AWS maintains backward compatibility, but API behavior could evolve

**Mitigation Strategy:** Implement robust error handling that can adapt to API response variations

### Risk 3: GetWorkGroup Permission Patterns

**Uncertainty:** Organizations may have inconsistent `GetWorkGroup` permissions across workgroups, leading to partial enhanced detail availability.

**Risk Assessment:** Low - Layered access approach handles partial permissions gracefully

**Mitigation Strategy:** Design clear indicators for information completeness levels and ensure tool provides value regardless of permission scope

## Success Measurement
