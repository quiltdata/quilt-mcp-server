# System Specifications: Enhanced Athena Workgroups Listing

**Issue #133**  
**Branch:** `133-bug-fail-athena_workgroups_list`  
**Specification Date:** 2025-09-10

## Overview

This specification defines the enhanced behavior for the `athena_workgroups_list` MCP tool to provide clean, user-friendly workgroup information while gracefully handling AWS permission limitations. The system shall maintain full backward compatibility while improving the user experience through better error handling and status reporting.

## Functional Requirements

### FR1: Workgroup Discovery and Classification

**Requirement:** The system shall discover and classify workgroups into accessible and restricted categories.

**Behavior:**

- Enumerate all workgroups using `ListWorkGroups` API
- Attempt detailed access validation for each workgroup using `GetWorkGroup` API
- Classify workgroups as either `accessible: true` or `accessible: false`
- Preserve all currently accessible workgroups in their current format

**Success Criteria:**

- All workgroups discovered by `ListWorkGroups` are included in results
- Accessible workgroups retain complete metadata (creation_time, output_location, etc.)
- Classification is deterministic and repeatable

### FR2: Enhanced Error Message Handling

**Requirement:** The system shall provide clean, user-friendly status information for restricted workgroups instead of exposing raw AWS exception messages.

**Current Problem:**

```json
{
  "description": "Access denied: An error occurred (AccessDeniedException) when calling the GetWorkGroup operation: You are not authorized to perform: athena:GetWorkGroup on the resource. After your AWS administrator or you have updated your permissions, please try again."
}
```

**Desired Behavior:**

- Replace raw exception messages with clean status indicators
- Preserve meaningful description content when available from `ListWorkGroups`
- Maintain separate error context for debugging purposes
- Provide consistent messaging across similar error conditions

**Success Criteria:**

- Description field contains clean, readable status information
- No raw AWS exception messages exposed to end users
- Consistent status messaging format across all restricted workgroups

### FR3: Enhanced State Reporting

**Requirement:** The system shall provide accurate state information for both accessible and restricted workgroups.

**Current Problem:**

- Accessible workgroups: Show actual state (`"ENABLED"`, `"DISABLED"`)
- Restricted workgroups: Show generic `"UNKNOWN"` state

**Desired Behavior:**

- Preserve actual state from `ListWorkGroups` response when available
- Use descriptive state indicators for permission-restricted workgroups
- Maintain clear distinction between actual state and access limitation

**Success Criteria:**

- State field reflects available information rather than access status
- Clear differentiation between workgroup state and access permissions
- Consistent state representation across authentication methods

### FR4: Granular Exception Handling

**Requirement:** The system shall handle different types of AWS exceptions with appropriate specificity and user guidance.

**Exception Categories:**

- `AccessDeniedException`: Permission-related restrictions (expected in enterprise environments)
- `WorkGroupNotFoundException`: Workgroup deleted between list and get operations
- `ThrottlingException`: API rate limiting issues
- Network/connectivity errors: Temporary infrastructure issues
- Other AWS service errors: Unexpected service conditions

**Desired Behavior:**

- Distinguish between permission errors and other failure types
- Provide specific user guidance based on error category
- Maintain diagnostic information for debugging without exposing technical details
- Enable appropriate retry logic for transient errors

**Success Criteria:**

- Different exception types result in appropriate user messaging
- Permission errors clearly indicated as expected behavior
- Transient errors distinguished from permanent access restrictions

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR1: Backward Compatibility

**Requirement:** The system shall maintain complete backward compatibility with existing integrations.

**Constraints:**

- JSON structure and field names must remain unchanged
- `accessible` field behavior must be preserved
- Summary statistics (`count`, `accessible_count`) must continue to work
- Formatting enhancement integration must be maintained

**Success Criteria:**

- Existing downstream consumers continue to function without modification
- All current field names and types remain consistent
- API contract remains unchanged

### NFR2: Performance Consistency

**Requirement:** The system shall maintain current performance characteristics while improving error handling.

**Constraints:**

- No additional AWS API calls beyond current implementation
- Error handling improvements should not impact successful path performance
- Memory usage should remain consistent with current implementation

**Success Criteria:**

- Response times for successful operations remain within 5% of current performance
- Memory usage does not increase significantly
- Error handling does not add measurable latency to success cases

### NFR3: Authentication Method Consistency

**Requirement:** The system shall provide consistent behavior across both Quilt3 and default AWS authentication methods.

**Constraints:**

- Quilt3 authentication with assumed roles (us-east-1 region)
- Default AWS credential chain authentication (environment-based region)
- Error handling must work identically for both authentication paths

**Success Criteria:**

- Identical error handling behavior regardless of authentication method
- Consistent result structure across authentication methods
- Region handling remains as currently implemented

## Quality Requirements

### QR1: User Experience Standards

**Requirement:** The system shall provide clear, actionable information to users about workgroup accessibility.

**Measurable Outcomes:**

- Zero raw AWS exception messages in user-facing fields
- Consistent status messaging format across all restricted workgroups
- Clear indication of next steps for users with limited permissions

**Validation Criteria:**

- Manual review of output confirms clean, professional presentation
- User testing confirms improved readability and comprehension
- Documentation accurately reflects expected behavior

### QR2: Diagnostic Capability

**Requirement:** The system shall maintain detailed diagnostic information for troubleshooting while improving user experience.

**Diagnostic Features:**

- Preserve error context in logging system
- Maintain debug-level information for AWS API failures
- Enable troubleshooting of permission and configuration issues

**Validation Criteria:**

- Log files contain sufficient detail for debugging AWS permission issues
- Debug information does not leak into user-facing responses
- Support personnel can diagnose issues using available log data

### QR3: Error Recovery and Resilience

**Requirement:** The system shall continue to provide useful information even when most workgroups are inaccessible.

**Resilience Patterns:**

- Partial failures do not prevent successful workgroup information from being returned
- Single workgroup access failures do not affect other workgroups
- System gracefully handles scenarios where zero workgroups are accessible

**Validation Criteria:**

- Tool provides value even with minimal AWS permissions
- Partial success scenarios return meaningful results
- Error conditions do not prevent tool completion

## Integration Requirements

### IR1: MCP Tool Interface Compliance

**Requirement:** The system shall maintain full compliance with MCP tool interface standards.

**Interface Contract:**

- Function signature: `athena_workgroups_list(use_quilt_auth: bool = True) -> Dict[str, Any]`
- Success response structure with `success: true` field
- Error response structure via `format_error_response()` utility

- Appropriate log levels used for different types of events
- Sensitive information (credentials, detailed error messages) not logged inappropriately

## Security and Compliance Requirements

### SR1: Credential Handling

**Requirement:** The system shall maintain secure credential handling patterns established in the codebase.

**Security Patterns:**

- No credential information in error messages or user-facing responses
- Secure handling of both Quilt3 and AWS credential sources
- No credential leakage in logging or diagnostic output

**Validation Criteria:**

- Security review confirms no credential exposure in any code path
- Error messages do not contain authentication details
- Logging output does not include sensitive credential information

### SR2: Error Information Exposure

**Requirement:** The system shall limit exposure of sensitive system information while maintaining diagnostic capability.

**Information Security:**

- AWS account numbers, role names, and detailed permission structures should not be exposed
- Error messages should be generic enough to avoid information disclosure
- Debug information should be available through logging without user exposure

**Validation Criteria:**

- User-facing error messages do not reveal sensitive system details
- Diagnostic information is available through appropriate channels
- No information leakage that could assist unauthorized access attempts

## Technical Uncertainties and Risks
