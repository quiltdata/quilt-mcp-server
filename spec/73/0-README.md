# Issue #73: UV Package Publishing

**Phase 2: Specification Complete** ‚úÖ

This specification defines the requirements and implementation approach for adding UV-based PyPI package
publishing to the quilt-mcp-server project.

## Specification Documents

### üìã [SPECIFICATION.md](./SPECIFICATION.md)

**Primary specification document** containing:

- End-user functional requirements (FR-1 through FR-4)
- Behavior-driven development scenarios  
- Integration test requirements
- Non-functional requirements (security, reliability, maintainability)
- Technical architecture and UV command research
- Implementation plan with phases

### üîç [INVESTIGATION.md](./INVESTIGATION.md)

**Phase 1 cross-validation findings** including:

- Current state analysis (UV foundation, Make targets, pyproject.toml)
- Gap identification (missing UV publishing, TestPyPI config, GitHub workflows)
- Technical research findings (UV commands, environment variables)
- Risk assessment and recommendations

### üß™ [BDD_TESTS.md](./BDD_TESTS.md)

**Comprehensive test specification** covering:

- Gherkin scenarios for all publishing workflows
- Integration test requirements with real UV commands
- Test implementation guidelines and fixture patterns
- Mock strategies for unit vs integration testing

## Requirements Summary

### Core Features to Implement

1. **Local TestPyPI Publishing** (`make publish-test`)
   - UV-based package building and publishing
   - Environment variable validation
   - Clear success/failure feedback

2. **GitHub Trust Publishing** (tag-triggered PyPI releases)
   - OIDC-based secure authentication
   - Automated workflow on version tags
   - Integration with existing release system

3. **Environment Configuration** (TestPyPI credentials in .env)
   - Consistent with existing project patterns
   - Comprehensive validation with helpful error messages

4. **Make Target Integration** (follows established patterns)
   - Environment loading via `sinclude .env`
   - Help documentation integration
   - Error handling and user guidance

### Technical Approach

- **Leverage Existing**: Strong UV foundation, Make patterns, environment management
- **Follow Patterns**: Consistent with established project conventions
- **Security First**: OIDC Trust Publishing, no stored secrets
- **Test Driven**: BDD scenarios, integration tests with real UV commands

## Implementation Readiness

### ‚úÖ Ready to Proceed

- All technical unknowns researched and resolved
- Clear implementation plan with phases
- Comprehensive BDD test specifications
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies

### Dependencies

- **Developer Setup**: TestPyPI account and token (local development)
- **Maintainer Setup**: GitHub Trust Publishing configuration (production)
- **No Code Dependencies**: Ready for immediate implementation

## Success Criteria

### Local Development

- `make publish-test` successfully publishes to TestPyPI
- Environment validation catches configuration issues early
- Clear, actionable error messages for common problems

### Production Release

- `git tag v1.0.0 && git push origin v1.0.0` triggers secure PyPI publishing
- Zero stored secrets (OIDC Trust Publishing only)
- Integration with existing release management workflow

**Next Phase**: Implementation (Phase 3)  
**Estimated Complexity**: Medium (leverages existing patterns)  
**Implementation Dependencies**: External account setup only
