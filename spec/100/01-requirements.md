# Requirements: Repository/Makefile Cleanup

**Issue**: [#100 - cleanup repo/make](https://github.com/quiltdata/quilt-mcp-server/issues/100)  
**Type**: Enhancement  
**Priority**: High

## Problem Statement

The repository is overly complicated with:

- Multiple Makefiles creating redundancy
- Complex tool/directory structures
- Numerous helper scripts
- Excessive automatic validation attempts

## User Story

As the Responsible Engineer, I want a minimalist, easily-traceable, logical code base so that I can make and validate changes easily.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **No redundancy between Makefiles** - Eliminate duplicate or conflicting build targets
2. **Narrow and shallow folder hierarchy** - Reduce directory nesting and complexity
3. **Everything in an "obvious place"** - Clear, intuitive organization of files and tools

## Implementation Approach

1. Review current file structure and identify complexity sources
2. Analyze all Makefiles and helper scripts for redundancy
3. Propose logical refactoring plan
4. Implement incrementally with testing to ensure functionality is preserved

## Success Criteria

- Simplified repository structure with clear organization
- Single source of truth for build processes
- Improved developer experience for making and validating changes
- Maintained functionality of existing workflows
