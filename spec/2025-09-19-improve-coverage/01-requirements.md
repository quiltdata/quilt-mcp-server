# Requirements â€” Issue #166 "improve coverage"

## Context

- **GitHub Issue**: [#166](https://github.com/quiltdata/quilt-mcp-server/issues/166)
- **Problem Statement**: Automated test suites currently lack sufficient coverage, creating high regression risk and limiting confidence in releases. The issue mandates higher coverage targets across unit, integration, and end-to-end (E2E) suites.
- **Business Impact**: Insufficient coverage increases production defects, slows delivery due to manual verification, and erodes trust in automation for Quilt MCP Server.

## User Stories

1. **As a Release Manager**, I want reliable automated coverage signals so that I can approve releases without manual retesting.
2. **As a Developer**, I want actionable coverage targets for each test layer so that I can focus test authoring where it matters most.
3. **As a QA Engineer**, I want E2E coverage to scale with product growth so that critical user journeys remain protected.
4. **As an Engineering Lead**, I want visibility into progressing coverage metrics so that I can enforce quality gates during CI.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Unit test coverage reaches at least **85%** overall, measured by the existing coverage tooling.
2. Integration test coverage reaches at least **50%**, reported via the same tooling and export formats.
3. End-to-end (E2E) coverage metrics are increased by **100%** relative to the current baseline (i.e., doubled coverage percentage or equivalent number of covered flows) and reported through existing dashboards.
4. Coverage reports are reproducible locally and in CI with documented commands.
5. CI pipeline fails when any coverage target regresses below the thresholds defined above.
6. Coverage deltas are visible per PR to support reviewer decision-making.

## High-Level Approach (Non-Technical)

- Treat coverage improvements as an iterative program, addressing the highest-risk gaps first.
- Build upon current testing infrastructure (pytest, integration harness, E2E runner) instead of replacing tools.
- Align coverage reporting enhancements with stakeholders (Release Manager, QA, Engineering Lead) to ensure adoption.

## Success Metrics

1. Coverage dashboards (local + CI) report the new thresholds within two consecutive runs.
2. Average PR cycle time decreases due to reduced manual verification requests.
3. No critical regression escapes in the first release following adoption (measured via release retro data).
4. Stakeholders confirm coverage data is actionable during release reviews.

## Stakeholders & Dependencies

- **Stakeholders**: Release Manager, QA Engineer, Developer contributors, Engineering Lead, DevOps maintaining CI.
- **Dependencies**: CI pipeline configuration, existing coverage tooling (pytest coverage plugins, integration harness reporters, E2E tooling), documentation in CLAUDE.md and Makefile targets.

## Open Questions

1. What are the current baseline coverage percentages for unit, integration, and E2E suites?
2. Where are coverage metrics currently published (e.g., artifacts, dashboards)?
3. Are there known flaky tests or unstable environments that could hinder coverage progress?
4. What is the acceptable timeline for incrementally reaching each coverage goal?
5. Does doubling E2E coverage refer to unique user flows covered, total assertions, or raw percentage output from existing tooling?
6. Are there compliance or auditing requirements that dictate specific reporting formats?

## Assumptions

- CI currently runs unit, integration, and E2E suites with coverage instrumentation available.
- Existing tooling supports capturing coverage at each test layer without significant re-engineering.
- Engineering leadership is prepared to enforce new coverage gates once implemented.
