# Phase 3 Design - Cleanup & Validation

## Objectives

1. Remove or repurpose any orphaned placeholder packages uncovered during earlier phases.
2. Ensure compatibility layers or re-exports are intentional and documented.
3. Validate the final layout with full test, lint, and coverage runs.

## Key Activities

- Delete empty directories (`config`, `operations`, `utilities`) if confirmed unused, or replace them with meaningful modules.
- Review compatibility shims introduced in Phase 2, documenting long-term maintenance plans.
- Run comprehensive validation (`make test`, `make lint`, `make coverage`) and capture results.
- Update checklists and reference docs with final state notes.

## Deliverables

- Cleaned `src/` structure free of dead packages.
- Documented compatibility notes in `CLAUDE.md`.
- Validation evidence recorded in the checklist for sign-off.
