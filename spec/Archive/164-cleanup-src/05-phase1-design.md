# Phase 1 Design - Inventory & Safety Net

## Objectives

1. Catalog single-file directories and justify whether they should be merged or retained.
2. Strengthen behavior-driven tests that exercise module discovery/import flows to prevent regressions during restructuring.
3. Produce an inventory artifact that informs later phases without touching production code yet.

## Key Activities

- Traverse `src/quilt_mcp` and document the current tree, identifying empty or placeholder packages.
- Review existing tests (e.g., `tests/unit/test_utils.py`, `tests/e2e/test_unified_search.py`) to confirm coverage of import-heavy workflows.
- Add or enhance tests that assert the MCP server exposes expected tool registrations via public APIs (not file paths).
- Record decisions in the phase checklist so reorganizations in later phases are backed by explicit rationale.

## Deliverables

- Updated tests capturing the expected behavior of tool discovery/imports (failing first per TDD).
- Phase 1 checklist entries populated with inventory findings and test status.
- No production code changes yet; only tests and documentation produced in this phase.
