# Integration Test Specification - README Auto-Testing

**✅ IMPLEMENTATION STATUS**: Core integration tests implemented. Advanced integration scenarios focusing on full server testing were simplified to maintain development velocity.

## 1. Integration Test Overview

This document defines the integration test requirements for the README auto-testing feature, ensuring seamless integration with existing project infrastructure while providing reliable automated validation of installation instructions.

## 2. Integration Points

### 2.1 Pytest Framework Integration ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **Integration Point**: `/tests/test_readme.py` (actual implementation)
- **Requirement**: Uses existing pytest configuration and patterns
- **Test Markers**: Standard pytest execution (no custom markers implemented)
- **Fixtures**: Uses built-in tempfile module for isolation

### 2.2 Make Target Integration ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **Integration Point**: Root `Makefile`
- **New Target**: `make test-readme` (implemented)
- **Dependencies**: Works with existing `uv sync --group test`
- **Output**: Standard pytest output format

### 2.3 CI/CD Pipeline Integration ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **Integration Point**: Existing GitHub Actions workflows
- **Requirement**: README tests included in standard test suite
- **Execution Context**: Runs as part of regular pytest execution
- **Failure Handling**: Blocks merges on test failures (via existing CI)

### 2.4 Environment Configuration Integration
- **Integration Point**: `env.example` and `.env` handling
- **Requirement**: Use existing environment variable patterns
- **Configuration**: Leverage existing AWS and Quilt configuration
- **Isolation**: Don't interfere with existing environment setup

## 3. Integration Test Cases

### 3.1 Pytest Integration Tests

#### Test Case: IT-001 - Pytest Suite Compatibility
```python
def test_readme_integration_with_existing_suite():
    """Verify README tests integrate cleanly with existing pytest suite."""
    # Given: Existing pytest configuration
    # When: README tests are executed with full suite
    # Then: All tests pass without conflicts
    # And: Test discovery includes README tests
    # And: Coverage reporting includes new code
```

#### Test Case: IT-002 - Pytest Marker Functionality
```python
@pytest.mark.readme_test
def test_readme_marker_filtering():
    """Verify README tests can be run independently via markers."""
    # Given: README tests are marked appropriately
    # When: Running pytest -m "readme_test"
    # Then: Only README tests execute
    # And: Test execution is isolated
```

#### Test Case: IT-003 - Fixture Compatibility  
```python
def test_readme_tests_use_existing_fixtures(temp_dir, mock_env):
    """Verify README tests leverage existing test fixtures."""
    # Given: Existing pytest fixtures for temp directories and env
    # When: README tests use these fixtures
    # Then: No fixture conflicts occur
    # And: Cleanup happens correctly
```

### 3.2 Make Target Integration Tests

#### Test Case: IT-004 - Make Target Execution
```bash
# Test: make test-readme executes successfully
make test-readme
# Expected: 
# - Returns 0 on success, non-zero on failure
# - Provides clear output of test progress
# - Integrates with existing make infrastructure
```

#### Test Case: IT-005 - Make Target Dependencies
```bash
# Test: make test-readme handles dependencies correctly
make clean && make test-readme
# Expected:
# - Automatically installs test dependencies
# - Sets up required environment variables
# - Executes without manual intervention
```

#### Test Case: IT-006 - Make Coverage Integration
```bash
# Test: README tests included in coverage reporting
make coverage
# Expected:
# - README testing framework included in coverage
# - Coverage percentage accounts for new code
# - Coverage report generation succeeds
```

### 3.3 CI/CD Integration Tests

#### Test Case: IT-007 - GitHub Actions Workflow
```yaml
# Workflow integration verification
name: Test README Integration
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test-readme:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Test README Installation
        run: make test-readme
# Expected: Workflow executes successfully in CI environment
```

#### Test Case: IT-008 - CI Environment Compatibility
```python
def test_ci_environment_execution():
    """Verify README tests work in GitHub Actions environment."""
    # Given: CI environment with limited resources
    # When: README tests execute in CI
    # Then: Tests complete within CI timeout limits
    # And: Temporary directories are created/cleaned correctly
    # And: Network access works for server verification
```

#### Test Case: IT-009 - PR Status Integration
```python
def test_pr_status_reporting():
    """Verify README test failures block PR merges."""
    # Given: PR with README test failures
    # When: CI pipeline executes
    # Then: PR status shows failure
    # And: Merge is blocked until tests pass
    # And: Failure details are visible in checks
```

### 3.4 Environment Integration Tests

#### Test Case: IT-010 - Environment Variable Handling
```python
def test_env_variable_integration():
    """Verify README tests respect existing environment configuration."""
    # Given: Existing .env configuration
    # When: README tests execute
    # Then: Tests use appropriate environment variables
    # And: AWS credentials are handled correctly
    # And: Quilt configuration is preserved
```

#### Test Case: IT-011 - Port Conflict Resolution
```python
def test_port_conflict_handling():
    """Verify README tests handle port conflicts gracefully."""
    # Given: Port 8000 is already in use
    # When: README test tries to start server
    # Then: Test detects port conflict
    # And: Appropriate error message is provided
    # And: Alternative solutions are suggested
```

#### Test Case: IT-012 - Cross-Platform Compatibility
```python
def test_cross_platform_integration():
    """Verify README tests work across different platforms."""
    # Given: Different operating systems (Linux, macOS)
    # When: README tests execute
    # Then: Commands work correctly on all platforms
    # And: Path handling is platform-appropriate
    # And: Process management works correctly
```
