# BDD Test Scenarios for README Auto-Testing

**✅ IMPLEMENTATION STATUS**: Core scenarios implemented with simplified scope focusing on bash syntax validation rather than full server testing.

## Feature: README Installation Command Testing

**As a** developer  
**I want** automated testing of README installation instructions  
**So that** users can reliably follow the documentation to set up the project

### Background
```gherkin
Given the repository has a README.md file
And the README contains "Option B: Local Development" section
And the development environment has required dependencies (uv, make, python3.11+)
```

## Scenario 1: Successful README Command Extraction and Validation ✅ IMPLEMENTED

```gherkin
Given I have a clean test environment
When I parse the README.md file
Then I should extract bash code blocks successfully
And all extracted bash blocks should have valid syntax
And basic commands like git clone, uv sync should be present
And command availability checks should pass
```

**Implementation Note**: Full server startup testing was simplified to basic command validation for maintainability.

## Scenario 2: Server Verification with MCP Protocol ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED

```gherkin
Given the server is running at http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp
When I send a POST request with MCP tools/list method
Then I should receive a valid JSON response
And the response should contain jsonrpc version "2.0"
And the response should include a list of available tools
And the response should contain tools like "packages_list", "bucket_objects_list"
```

**Implementation Note**: This scenario was deemed too complex for the initial implementation. The focus was kept on bash syntax validation only.

## Scenario 3: Environment Isolation Testing

```gherkin
Given I run the README test multiple times
When I execute the test in parallel
Then each test should use its own temporary directory
And tests should not interfere with each other
And all temporary directories should be cleaned up after completion
```

## Scenario 4: Command Execution Error Handling

```gherkin
Given I have a test environment with missing dependencies
When the "uv sync" command fails due to missing uv
Then the test should fail gracefully
And I should receive a clear error message indicating "uv command not found"
And the temporary test environment should be cleaned up
```

## Scenario 5: Server Startup Failure Handling

```gherkin
Given I have successfully run "uv sync"
When the "make app" command fails to start the server
Then the test should wait for the configured timeout period
And the test should fail with a "server startup failed" message
And I should receive the server's stdout and stderr output
And any running processes should be terminated
```

## Scenario 6: README Parsing Edge Cases

```gherkin
Given the README.md file contains comments and blank lines
When I parse the "Option B: Local Development" section
Then I should ignore comment lines starting with "#"
And I should ignore blank lines
And I should preserve command ordering
And I should handle multi-line commands correctly
```

## Scenario 7: Port Conflict Resolution

```gherkin
Given port 8000 is already in use by another process
When I start the server using "make app"
Then the test should detect the port conflict
And I should receive an appropriate error message
And the test should suggest alternative solutions
```

## Scenario 8: Cross-Platform Compatibility

```gherkin
Given I am running on different operating systems
When I execute the README commands
Then the commands should work on Linux systems
And the commands should work on macOS systems
And path separators should be handled correctly
And file permissions should be set appropriately
```

## Scenario 9: Performance Requirements

```gherkin
Given I start the README testing process
When I execute all commands and server verification
Then the total test time should be less than 60 seconds
And the server startup verification should take less than 10 seconds
And command execution should have appropriate timeouts
```

## Scenario 10: Integration with Existing Test Suite

```gherkin
Given I run the existing pytest test suite
When I include the README tests
Then all existing tests should continue to pass
And the README tests should be executed as part of the suite
And test coverage should include the new README testing framework
And I should be able to run README tests independently
```

## Scenario 11: CI/CD Pipeline Integration

```gherkin
Given the GitHub Actions workflow is configured
When a pull request is submitted
Then the README tests should execute automatically
And the tests should pass before allowing merge
And test results should be visible in the PR status
And any failures should block the merge process
```

## Scenario 12: Make Target Integration

```gherkin
Given the project Makefile is configured
When I run "make test-readme"
Then the README tests should execute
And I should see detailed output of each command execution
And the make target should return appropriate exit codes
And the target should integrate with existing make commands
```

## Test Data Requirements

### Mock README Content
```markdown
#### Option B: Local Development

For development or custom configurations:

```bash
# 1. Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/quiltdata/quilt-mcp-server.git
cd quilt-mcp-server
cp env.example .env
# Edit .env with your AWS credentials and Quilt settings

# 2. Install dependencies
uv sync

# 3. Run server
make app
# Server available at http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp
```
```

### Expected MCP Response
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": {
    "tools": [
      {
        "name": "packages_list",
        "description": "List packages with filtering and search"
      },
      {
        "name": "bucket_objects_list", 
        "description": "List and filter S3 objects"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Environment Configuration
```bash
# Test environment variables
TEST_TIMEOUT=60
SERVER_STARTUP_TIMEOUT=10
TEST_PORT=8000
TEST_TEMP_DIR=/tmp/readme_test_*
CLEANUP_ON_FAILURE=true
```
