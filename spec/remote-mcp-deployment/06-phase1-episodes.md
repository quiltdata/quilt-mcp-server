# Phase 1 Episodes — Discovery & Planning

## Episode 1 — AWS Environment Recon (Red)
- Write failing infrastructure test that expects placeholders for MCP resources (e.g., Terraform plan lacking MCP module).

## Episode 2 — Document Findings (Green)
- Produce discovery document summarizing ECS/ALB/IAM landscape and auth requirements.
- Update failing test expectations with actual data (still failing until module exists).

## Episode 3 — Planning Validation (Refactor)
- Refine documentation, resolve open questions, and adjust test scaffolding for upcoming phases.
