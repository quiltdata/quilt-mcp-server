# Phase 3 Design — Integration & Testing

## Objectives
1. Integrate MCP endpoint with Quilt frontend and auth systems.
2. Validate end-to-end communication (frontend → ALB → MCP) including SSE behavior.
3. Establish monitoring, logging, and alerting baselines.

## Key Tasks
- Configure frontend environment variables/clients to use remote MCP URL.
- Implement CORS and auth checks in MCP server (headers, token validation).
- Run smoke tests (FastMCP proxy, frontend dev build) against deployed service.
- Configure CloudWatch logs/metrics dashboards; optionally set alarms.
- Extend Terraform/pytest tests to cover auth/CORS variables if feasible.

## Deliverables
- Working frontend integration (dev/staging) verified.
- Auth/CORS configuration committed with documentation.
- Monitoring documentation/log group references.
- Updated tests/automation covering integration scenarios.
