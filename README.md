## Configuration

### Authentication

quilt-mcp supports **dual-mode authentication** at runtime:

- **JWT (web deployments):** When the HTTP transport provides a bearer token, the server verifies it and uses the JWT-derived AWS session for all tools.
- **IAM/quilt3 (desktop & CLIs):** Without a JWT, the server transparently falls back to the existing quilt3 login flow so local workflows keep working.

Configure or refresh quilt3 credentials with:

```bash
# Configure catalog and authenticate (interactive)
quilt3 config

# Or set directly
quilt3 config https://your-catalog.quiltdata.com

# Login (opens browser for SSO, or prompts for credentials)
quilt3 login
```

Your credentials are stored in `~/.quilt/` and automatically used by quilt-mcp whenever a JWT is not present.

To **require JWTs** in production deployments, set `MCP_REQUIRE_JWT=true`. In strict mode, bucket and package tools return a clear error instead of falling back to quilt3 credentials.

### Environment Variables

Override defaults via environment or MCP config:

- `QUILT_CATALOG_DOMAIN` - Your Quilt catalog URL (e.g., `your-catalog.quiltdata.com`)
- `QUILT_DEFAULT_BUCKET` - Default S3 bucket (e.g., `s3://your-bucket`)
- `AWS_PROFILE` - AWS credentials profile for S3 access
- `MCP_REQUIRE_JWT` - Set to `true` to reject IAM/quilt3 fallback and enforce JWT-only access

## Development

# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/quiltdata/quilt-mcp-server.git

## Troubleshooting

### SyntaxWarning from jsonlines

You may see this warning during installation:

```text
SyntaxWarning: invalid escape sequence '\*'
```

**This is harmless.** It's from the `jsonlines` dependency (via `quilt3`) and doesn't affect functionality.
The warning appears on Python 3.12+ due to deprecated escape sequences in the library's docstrings.
