## Using with Cursor

You can run the MCP server locally and point Cursor to it.

Run the server with uv (pick one):

```bash
# Run in-repo (development)
uv run quilt-mcp

# Or run via uvx (no local install needed)
uvx quilt-mcp
```

Configure Cursor to launch the server (GUI or JSON):

- Cursor Settings ‚Üí MCP (or Command Palette ‚Üí ‚ÄúMCP: Configure Servers‚Äù) ‚Üí Add New Server
  - Command: `uvx`
  - Args: `quilt-mcp`
  - Working directory: repository root (optional)

Or add JSON to your Cursor settings (example):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "quilt": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["quilt-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "QUILT_CATALOG_DOMAIN": "demo.quiltdata.com"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Using with VS Code

For VS Code assistants that support MCP servers, configure a command‚Äëbased server entry pointing to this CLI.

Run the server with uv (pick one):

```bash
# Development
uv run quilt-mcp

# Ephemeral
uvx quilt-mcp
```

Example MCP server configuration (JSON) for extensions that support `mcpServers`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "quilt": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["quilt-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "QUILT_CATALOG_DOMAIN": "demo.quiltdata.com"
      },
      "description": "Quilt MCP Server"
    }
  }
}
```

## Architecture

This project uses a **4-phase deployment pipeline**:

```tree
fast-mcp-server/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app/           # Phase 1: Local MCP server (Python)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ build-docker/  # Phase 2: Docker containerization  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ catalog-push/  # Phase 3: ECR registry operations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ deploy-aws/    # Phase 4: ECS/ALB deployment
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ shared/        # Common utilities (validation, testing)
```

Each phase is **atomic** and **testable** independently, following SPEC.md validation requirements.

## MCP Tools

This server provides 13 secure tools for Quilt data operations:

### Package Management

- **`packages_list`** - List packages in a registry with optional filtering
- **`packages_search`** - Search packages using ElasticSearch  
- **`package_browse`** - Examine package contents and structure
- **`package_contents_search`** - Search within a specific package
- **`package_create`** - Create new packages from S3 objects
- **`package_update`** - Update existing packages with new files
- **`package_delete`** - Remove packages from registry

### S3 Operations

- **`bucket_objects_list`** - List objects in S3 buckets
- **`bucket_object_info`** - Get metadata for specific objects
- **`bucket_object_text`** - Read text content from objects
- **`bucket_objects_put`** - Upload objects to S3
- **`bucket_object_fetch`** - Download object data

### System Tools

- **`auth_check`** - Verify Quilt authentication status
- **`filesystem_check`** - Check system environment details

## Requirements

- **AWS Account** with CLI configured  
- **Python 3.11+** in user's login environment (required for Claude Desktop usage)
- **[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager** for development
- **Docker** for containerization
- **IAM Policy ARN** for S3 access to your Quilt buckets

> **Note**: Claude Desktop uses Python from your user's login shell environment, not from virtual environments. Ensure Python 3.11+ is accessible via `python3` in your shell profile (.bashrc, .zshrc, etc.).

```

## Port Configuration

Each phase uses different ports to avoid conflicts:

| Phase | Description | Port | Endpoint |
|-------|-------------|------|----------|
| Phase 1 | Local app | 8000 | `http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp` |
| Phase 2 | Docker build | 8001 | `http://127.0.0.1:8001/mcp` |
| Phase 3 | ECR catalog | 8002 | `http://127.0.0.1:8002/mcp` |
| Phase 4 | AWS deploy | 443/80 | `https://your-alb-url/mcp` |

## Development Workflow

### Local Development

```bash
make app                          # Local server on http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp
```

### SPEC-Compliant Pipeline

```bash
# Complete validation (recommended)
make validate

# Step-by-step development
make init-app                     # Check preconditions
make app                          # Run phase
make test-app                     # Test artifacts
make -C app test-tools            # Run tool-focused tests (metadata, buckets, quilt tools)
make verify-app                   # Verify MCP endpoint
make zero-app                     # Cleanup processes
```

### Testing Individual Phases

```bash
# Test specific phases
make verify-build                 # Test Docker container
make verify-catalog               # Test ECR image
make verify-deploy                # Test deployed service
```

## Environment Management

The system automatically loads environment variables from `.env` via `shared/common.sh`:

- Variables are auto-derived when possible (e.g., ECR_REGISTRY from AWS account)
- Use `make check-env` to see current configuration
- ECR_REGISTRY is constructed automatically if not provided
- AWS credentials use your configured AWS CLI profile

## Manual Testing

### MCP Endpoint Testing

```bash
# Test local server
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/mcp \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/list","params":{}}'

# Test Docker container (Phase 2)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/mcp \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/list","params":{}}'

# Test ECR image (Phase 3)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8002/mcp \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/list","params":{}}'
```

### AWS Service Testing

```bash
# View deployment status
make status

# View ECS logs
aws logs tail /ecs/quilt-mcp --follow --region us-east-1

# Test deployed endpoint (requires authentication)
# See docs/CLAUDE.md for full authentication setup
```

## Cleanup

```bash
# Clean local artifacts
make clean

# Stop all running containers/processes
make zero-app zero-build zero-catalog

# Remove AWS resources
make destroy
```

## Security

- All ECS tasks use IAM roles with minimal required permissions
- API endpoints are protected with JWT authentication via ALB
- Docker builds are isolated and use official base images
- No secrets are logged or exposed in responses
- Environment variables are managed via `.env` (not committed)

      },
      "description": "Quilt MCP Server"
    }
  }
}
```

Notes
- If your editor expects a static TCP/WebSocket endpoint instead of a command, you can expose the local server with `make remote-export` and point the client at the printed URL‚Äôs `/mcp` path.
- Ensure your shell environment includes any required Quilt settings (see Configuration) before launching the server.
