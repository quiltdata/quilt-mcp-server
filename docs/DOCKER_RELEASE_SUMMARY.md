# Docker Release Workflow - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Created a comprehensive Docker release workflow that handles building AMD64 images, pushing to ECR, updating ECS task definitions, and deploying to Fargate services with a single command.

## What Was Added

### 1. ECS Deployment Script (`scripts/ecs_deploy.py`)

A Python script that manages ECS deployments:
- Updates task definitions with new container images
- Deploys updated task definitions to ECS services
- Waits for service deployment to stabilize
- Supports dry-run mode for testing
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

**Key Features:**
- Automatic task definition updates
- Service deployment with health check waiting
- Configurable timeouts
- Multi-region support

**Usage:**
```bash
uv run python scripts/ecs_deploy.py \
  --image <image-uri> \
  --cluster quilt-mcp-cluster \
  --service quilt-mcp-service \
  --task-family quilt-mcp-task
```

### 2. Enhanced Docker Build Script (`scripts/docker.py`)

Enhanced the existing Docker script with platform support:
- Added `--platform` flag for cross-platform builds
- Support for building AMD64 images on ARM64 (Apple Silicon)
- Updated `build()`, `build_and_push()`, and `cmd_push()` functions
- Environment variable `DOCKER_PLATFORM` for platform override

**Key Changes:**
```python
def build(self, tag: str, platform: Optional[str] = None) -> bool:
    """Build Docker image with optional platform specification."""
    build_cmd = ["docker", "build", "--file", "Dockerfile"]
    if platform:
        build_cmd.extend(["--platform", platform])
    build_cmd.extend(["--tag", tag, "."])
    # ...
```

### 3. New Make Targets (`make.deploy`)

Added comprehensive make targets for Docker operations:

#### Build Targets
- `docker-build` - Build locally (native architecture)
- `docker-build-amd64` - Build for AMD64 (ECS compatible)
- `docker-push` - Build and push to ECR
- `docker-push-amd64` - Build and push AMD64 to ECR
- `docker-push-dev` - Build and push development version

#### Deployment Targets
- `ecs-deploy` - Deploy specific image to ECS (with wait)
- `ecs-deploy-no-wait` - Deploy without waiting for stabilization

#### Complete Workflows
- **`docker-release`** - Production release (build AMD64 → push → deploy → wait)
- **`docker-release-dev`** - Development release with timestamped version

#### Configuration Variables
```makefile
ECS_CLUSTER ?= quilt-mcp-cluster
ECS_SERVICE ?= quilt-mcp-service
ECS_TASK_FAMILY ?= quilt-mcp-task
AWS_REGION ?= us-east-1
DOCKER_PLATFORM ?= linux/amd64
```

### 4. Documentation (`docs/DOCKER_RELEASE.md`)

Comprehensive documentation covering:
- Quick start guide
- Architecture overview
- Available make targets
- Configuration options
- Step-by-step manual workflow
- Scripts reference
- Troubleshooting guide
- CI/CD integration examples
- Multi-region deployment
- Best practices

## Usage Examples

### Quick Start - Production Release

```bash
# Build AMD64, push to ECR, deploy to ECS, wait for completion
make docker-release
```

This single command:
1. Builds Docker image for AMD64 (ECS compatible)
2. Pushes to ECR with version tag and `latest` tag
3. Creates new ECS task definition revision
4. Updates ECS service to use new task definition
5. Waits for service to stabilize (up to 10 minutes)
6. Reports success/failure

### Development Release

```bash
# Build and deploy timestamped dev version
make docker-release-dev
```

Creates version like `1.2.3-dev-20251002143000` and deploys without tagging as `latest`.

### Custom Configuration

```bash
# Deploy to custom cluster/service
ECS_CLUSTER=my-cluster \
ECS_SERVICE=my-service \
ECS_TASK_FAMILY=my-task \
make docker-release
```

### Manual Deployment

```bash
# Deploy a specific image
make ecs-deploy IMAGE_URI=712023778557.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/quilt-mcp-server:1.2.3
```

## Architecture

### Workflow Steps

```
┌─────────────────┐
│  1. Build       │  Build Docker image for AMD64
│     (AMD64)     │  - Cross-compile if needed
└────────┬────────┘  - Tag with version
         │
         ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│  2. Push to ECR │  Upload to Amazon ECR
└────────┬────────┘  - Authenticate with ECR
         │           - Push version tag
         │           - Push 'latest' tag
         ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│  3. Update Task │  Create new task definition
│     Definition  │  - Get current task def
└────────┬────────┘  - Update image URI
         │           - Register new revision
         ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│  4. Deploy      │  Update ECS service
│     Service     │  - Force new deployment
└────────┬────────┘  - Wait for stabilization
         │           - Monitor health checks
         ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│  ✅ Complete    │  Service running with new image
└─────────────────┘
```

### AMD64 Requirement

ECS Fargate requires AMD64 architecture. The workflow automatically:
- Builds for `linux/amd64` platform
- Cross-compiles if running on ARM64 (Apple Silicon)
- Ensures compatibility with Fargate

### Error Handling

Each step includes comprehensive error handling:
- **Build failures**: Docker build errors are captured and reported
- **Push failures**: ECR authentication and upload errors
- **Task definition errors**: Invalid configurations are caught
- **Deployment failures**: Service update errors with rollback capability
- **Timeout handling**: Configurable timeouts with clear error messages

## Integration Points

### Version Management

Automatically uses version from `pyproject.toml`:
```bash
# Version is read via scripts/version.py
PACKAGE_VERSION := $(shell python3 scripts/version.py get-version)
```

### AWS Integration

- ECR for container registry
- ECS Fargate for container orchestration
- CloudWatch for logs (referenced in troubleshooting)
- IAM roles for permissions

### CI/CD Ready

The workflow is designed for CI/CD pipelines:
- Non-interactive execution
- Clear exit codes (0 = success, 1 = failure)
- Comprehensive logging to stderr
- Environment variable configuration
- Dry-run mode for testing

## Testing

The workflow has been tested with:
- ✅ Build step produces valid AMD64 images
- ✅ Push step uploads to ECR with correct tags
- ✅ Help system displays new targets correctly
- ✅ Configuration variables can be overridden

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions:
- [ ] Blue/green deployment support
- [ ] Canary deployments
- [ ] Rollback automation
- [ ] Multi-region deployment orchestration
- [ ] Health check validation before marking complete
- [ ] Slack/email notifications on deployment
- [ ] Deployment metrics and timing
