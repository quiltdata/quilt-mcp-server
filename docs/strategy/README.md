# MCP Authentication & Deployment Strategy Bundle

## Contents
- `MCP_SECURITY_STRATEGY.md` – Business objectives, current-state assessment, phased implementation plan, and security priorities.
- `MCP_IMPLEMENTATION_SPEC.md` – Detailed technical requirements, file layout, method contracts, testing strategy, and migration plan.
- `../architecture/MCP_AUTH_ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAM.md` – Mermaid diagram showing client flows, runtime context, and AWS infrastructure components.
- `../architecture/AUTHENTICATION_ARCHITECTURE.md` – Expanded narrative covering runtime context, AWS footprint, and customer deployment guidance.

## How to Use This Bundle
1. **Alignment** – Review the strategy document with product/security stakeholders to confirm objectives, success metrics, and phased plan.
2. **Design & Build** – Follow the implementation spec when updating runtime code, tools, and infrastructure modules.
3. **Communicate** – Share the architecture diagram during design reviews to illustrate data flow and component responsibilities.
4. **Deploy** – Use the documented Terraform/CDK/CloudFormation guidance to onboard customer accounts securely.

## Implementation Phases (Summary)
- **Week 1**: Secrets Manager integration, SG hardening, runtime telemetry.
- **Week 2**: Deliver CDK & CloudFormation variants, publish IAM policy bundles.
- **Week 3**: Expand testing/observability, add CloudWatch dashboards.
- **Week 4**: Pilot customer deployment, collect feedback, finalise documentation.

## Success Criteria Snapshot
- No plaintext secrets in task definitions (validated by IaC checks).
- Runtime context regression tests passing in CI.
- Auditable deployment artefacts (Terraform/CDK/CFN) adopted by at least one pilot.
- Auth failure rate < 1% across desktop & web clients.

## Next Steps
1. Implement Secrets Manager/egress updates in Terraform module; backfill tests.
2. Scaffold CDK construct & CloudFormation template mirroring Terraform resources.
3. Run pilot deployment following migration checklist; capture lessons learned in strategy doc.
