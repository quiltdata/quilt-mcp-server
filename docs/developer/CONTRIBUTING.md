### ‚ú® Feature Requests

When requesting features, please include:

**Required Information:**
- **Use Case**: Why is this feature needed?
- **User Story**: \"As a [user type], I want [goal] so that [benefit]\"
- **Acceptance Criteria**: How do we know when it's complete?
- **Implementation Ideas**: Suggestions for how to implement (optional)
- **Alternatives Considered**: Other solutions you've considered

**Feature Request Template:**
```markdown
## Feature Summary
Brief description of the proposed feature

## Use Case
Detailed explanation of why this feature is needed

## User Story
As a bioinformatics researcher, I want to search for packages by genomic coordinates so that I can find relevant datasets for my analysis region.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Support genomic coordinate queries (chr:start-end format)
- [ ] Integrate with existing unified search system
- [ ] Return packages with overlapping genomic regions
- [ ] Include confidence scores for matches
- [ ] Handle multiple genome builds (GRCh38, GRCh37)

## Implementation Ideas
- Add genomic coordinate parser to search module
- Extend GraphQL queries to include genomic metadata
- Create new tool `search_by_coordinates`

## Alternatives Considered
- Manual filtering of search results
- External genomic database integration

## Additional Context
This would support our genomics workflow where we need to find datasets overlapping specific chromosomal regions.

#### Adding New MCP Tools

When adding new tools, follow this structure:

```python
# app/quilt_mcp/tools/your_new_tool.py

from typing import Dict, Any, Optional
from ..validators import validate_required_params

async def your_new_tool(
    required_param: str,
    optional_param: Optional[str] = None,
    **kwargs
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    \"\"\"
    Brief description of what this tool does.
    
    Args:
        required_param: Description of required parameter
        optional_param: Description of optional parameter
        
    Returns:
        Dict containing:
        - success: Whether operation succeeded
        - data: Tool-specific response data
        - message: Human-readable status message
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: When required parameters are invalid
        ConnectionError: When external service is unavailable
    \"\"\"
    # Validate inputs
    validate_required_params({'required_param': required_param})
    
    try:
        # Implementation here
        result = await some_async_operation(required_param)
        
        return {
            'success': True,
            'data': result,
            'message': f'Successfully processed {required_param}'
        }
    except Exception as e:
        return {
            'success': False,
            'error': str(e),
            'message': f'Failed to process {required_param}: {str(e)}'
        }
```

**Tool Requirements:**

- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling with meaningful messages
- **Input Validation**: Validate all inputs using our validator functions
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive docstrings with examples
- **Testing**: Unit tests with 85%+ coverage
- **Real-World Testing**: Include in integration test scenarios

#### Testing Requirements

**Unit Tests:**
```python

from app.quilt_mcp.tools.your_new_tool import your_new_tool

class TestYourNewTool:
    @pytest.mark.asyncio
    async def test_successful_operation(self):
        \"\"\"Test successful tool execution\"\"\"
        result = await your_new_tool(required_param=\"test_value\")
        
        assert result['success'] is True
        assert 'data' in result
        assert result['message'].startswith('Successfully')
    
    @pytest.mark.asyncio
    async def test_invalid_input(self):
        \"\"\"Test error handling for invalid input\"\"\"
        with pytest.raises(ValueError):
            await your_new_tool(required_param=\"\")
    
    @pytest.mark.asyncio
    async def test_external_service_failure(self):
        \"\"\"Test graceful handling of external service failures\"\"\"
        with patch('app.quilt_mcp.tools.your_new_tool.some_async_operation') as mock_op:
            mock_op.side_effect = ConnectionError(\"Service unavailable\")
            
            result = await your_new_tool(required_param=\"test\")
            
            assert result['success'] is False
            assert 'Service unavailable' in result['error']
```

**Integration Tests:**
```python
# Add to test_cases/comprehensive_test_scenarios.json
{
  \"test_id\": \"your_new_tool_integration\",
  \"description\": \"Test your new tool with real data\",
  \"tool_name\": \"your_new_tool\",
  \"parameters\": {

## üìù Code Style and Standards

### Python Code Style

We follow PEP 8 with these specific guidelines:

```python
# Good: Clear function names and documentation
async def create_package_from_s3_objects(
    package_name: str,
    s3_uris: List[str],
    metadata: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    \"\"\"
    Create a Quilt package from S3 objects with intelligent organization.
    
    Args:
        package_name: Name in namespace/package format
        s3_uris: List of S3 URIs to include
        metadata: Optional metadata dictionary
        
    Returns:
        Package creation result with status and details
    \"\"\"
    
# Good: Error handling with context
try:
    result = await quilt_operation()
except QuiltAPIError as e:
    logger.error(f\"Quilt API error in {operation_name}: {e}\")
    return {
        'success': False,
        'error': f\"Quilt API error: {e}\",
        'message': f\"Failed to {operation_name}. Please check your Quilt configuration.\"
    }

# Good: Input validation
if not package_name or '/' not in package_name:
    raise ValueError(\"Package name must be in 'namespace/package' format\")
```
