# Story 3: Standalone DXT Distribution Packaging

## Story Summary

**As a** customer or support engineer  
**I want** a complete, standalone DXT distribution package  
**So that** I can easily install and troubleshoot DXT without missing dependencies or documentation

## Story Details

### Current State Analysis

**Existing DXT Distribution:**

- Current `make release` creates basic DXT package
- Uses `@anthropic-ai/dxt pack` for official packaging
- Missing comprehensive documentation for customers
- No bundled troubleshooting or environment setup tools
- Limited distribution validation

**Identified Gaps:**

- No customer-facing README with installation instructions
- Missing robust prerequisites script in distribution
- No troubleshooting guide or support documentation
- Limited validation that distribution is complete and functional
- No versioning or metadata in distribution package

#### Enhanced Makefile Integration

```makefile
# Add to tools/dxt/Makefile
DIST_VERSION ?= $(shell git describe --tags --always)
DIST_DIR = dist/quilt-mcp-dxt-$(DIST_VERSION)
DIST_ZIP = dist/quilt-mcp-dxt-$(DIST_VERSION).zip

create-distribution: build validate test-comprehensive
 @echo "Creating standalone distribution package..."
 mkdir -p $(DIST_DIR)
 $(MAKE) copy-distribution-files
 $(MAKE) generate-distribution-metadata
 $(MAKE) validate-distribution
 cd dist && zip -r quilt-mcp-dxt-$(DIST_VERSION).zip quilt-mcp-dxt-$(DIST_VERSION)/
 @echo "Distribution package created: $(DIST_ZIP)"

copy-distribution-files:
 # Copy core DXT package
 cp build/quilt-mcp-server.dxt $(DIST_DIR)/dxt/
 cp assets/manifest.json $(DIST_DIR)/dxt/
 
 # Copy enhanced prerequisites and setup scripts
 cp assets/check-prereqs.sh $(DIST_DIR)/
 cp -r assets/environment-setup $(DIST_DIR)/scripts/
 cp -r assets/diagnostic $(DIST_DIR)/scripts/
 
 # Copy documentation
 $(MAKE) generate-customer-documentation
 
 # Copy installer
 cp scripts/install.sh $(DIST_DIR)/

validate-distribution:
 @echo "Validating distribution completeness..."
 $(MAKE) test-distribution-integrity
 $(MAKE) test-distribution-installation
```

### Implementation Details

#### Phase 1: Customer Documentation Generation

1. **Customer-facing README.md**:

   ```markdown
   # Quilt MCP Server Desktop Extension (DXT)
   
   ## Quick Installation
   
   1. Extract this package to your preferred location
   2. Run `./install.sh` to install the DXT
   3. Follow the prompts to configure Claude Desktop
   
   ## System Requirements
   
   - Python 3.11 or higher
   - Claude Desktop application
   - AWS credentials configured
   - Network access for dependency installation
   
   ## Troubleshooting
   
   If installation fails, see `docs/troubleshooting.md` for solutions.
   ```

2. **Comprehensive documentation suite**:
   - Installation guide with step-by-step instructions
   - Troubleshooting guide covering common issues from brownfield-architecture.md
   - Environment setup guide for different platforms
   - Support guide with contact information and escalation

#### Phase 2: One-Command Installer

1. **install.sh script**:

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   # Quilt MCP DXT Installer
   
   set -e
   
   echo "Quilt MCP Desktop Extension Installer"
   echo "======================================"
   
   # Run prerequisites check
   echo "Checking system requirements..."
   if ! ./check-prereqs.sh; then
       echo "Prerequisites check failed. See docs/troubleshooting.md"
       exit 1
   fi
   
   # Install DXT package
   echo "Installing DXT package..."
   # Installation logic here
   
   echo "Installation completed successfully!"
   echo "See docs/installation-guide.md for Claude Desktop configuration"
   ```

2. **Interactive installation flow**:
   - Progress indicators and status updates
   - Error handling with actionable guidance
   - Option to continue on warnings vs. errors
   - Post-installation verification and testing

#### Phase 3: Distribution Validation and Testing

1. **Distribution integrity testing**:
   - Verify all expected files are present
   - Validate file checksums and integrity
   - Test that DXT package loads correctly
   - Verify documentation completeness

2. **Clean environment installation testing**:
   - Test installation in isolated environment
   - Verify prerequisites check works correctly
   - Test complete installation flow
   - Validate post-installation functionality

#### Phase 4: Metadata and Versioning

1. **Build metadata generation**:

   ```json
   {
     "version": "1.2.3",
     "build_date": "2025-01-02T10:30:00Z",
     "git_commit": "abc123def456",
     "build_environment": {
       "python_version": "3.11.5",
       "uv_version": "0.1.18",
       "dxt_cli_version": "1.0.0"
     },
     "included_components": {
       "mcp_server_version": "0.5.6",
       "quilt3_version": "5.6.0",
       "total_tools": 84
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Distribution manifest**:
   - Complete inventory of all files
   - File checksums for integrity verification
   - Dependency information and versions
   - Installation requirements and compatibility

### Customer Experience Flow

#### Scenario 1: Successful Installation

1. **Download and extract** distribution package
2. **Run** `./install.sh` for automated installation
3. **Prerequisites check** passes automatically
4. **DXT installation** completes successfully
5. **Configuration** guidance provided for Claude Desktop
6. **Verification** confirms DXT is working correctly

#### Scenario 2: Environment Issues

1. **Download and extract** distribution package
2. **Run** `./install.sh` for automated installation
3. **Prerequisites check** identifies Python version issue
4. **Clear guidance** provided with specific fix commands
5. **User fixes** environment based on guidance
6. **Retry installation** succeeds after fixes

#### Scenario 3: Corporate Environment

1. **IT administrator** reviews distribution contents
2. **Prerequisites check** identifies proxy/firewall restrictions
3. **Offline installation** options provided
4. **Corporate environment** setup scripts available
5. **Custom configuration** guidance for restricted environments

### Dependencies

**External Dependencies:**

- Git for version tagging and metadata
- zip utility for distribution packaging
- Existing `@anthropic-ai/dxt pack` CLI

**Internal Dependencies:**

- Enhanced prerequisites script from Story 2
- Comprehensive testing framework from Story 1
- Existing `tools/dxt/Makefile` build system

### Integration with Other Stories

**Story 1 Integration**: Comprehensive testing validates distribution:

- Test distribution package integrity
- Validate installation flow in multiple environments
- Test customer scenarios with packaged distribution

**Story 2 Integration**: Environment validation enhances distribution:

- Enhanced prerequisites script included in distribution
- Environment setup scripts bundled for customer use
- Troubleshooting documentation covers validation scenarios

### Risks and Mitigations

**Risk 1: Distribution package becomes too large or complex**

- **Mitigation**: Optimize documentation size, compress effectively
- **Fallback**: Create minimal and full distribution variants

**Risk 2: Installation script fails in unexpected environments**

- **Mitigation**: Extensive cross-platform testing, graceful error handling
- **Fallback**: Manual installation instructions as backup

**Risk 3: Distribution validation adds significant build time**

- **Mitigation**: Parallel validation processes, incremental validation
- **Fallback**: Make comprehensive validation optional for development builds

### Definition of Done

- [ ] Complete standalone distribution package with all components
- [ ] One-command installer with comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Customer documentation suite covering all scenarios
- [ ] Distribution validation and integrity testing
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility verified
- [ ] Integration with existing build process complete

### Success Metrics

- **Installation Success Rate**: >95% first-time installation success
- **Customer Satisfaction**: Clear, actionable documentation reduces support tickets by 80%
- **Distribution Integrity**: 0% corrupted or incomplete distribution packages
- **Time to Value**: Reduce customer setup time from hours to <15 minutes

### Versioning and Release Process

- **Semantic Versioning**: Follow semver for distribution versions
- **Automated Builds**: Integrate with CI/CD for automated distribution creation
- **Release Notes**: Auto-generate release notes from git commits and PRs
- **Distribution Archive**: Maintain archive of previous versions for support
