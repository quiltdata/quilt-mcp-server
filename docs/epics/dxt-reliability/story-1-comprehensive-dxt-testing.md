# Story 1: Comprehensive DXT Testing Framework

## Story Summary

**As a** DXT maintainer  
**I want** comprehensive testing of the actual bundled DXT package in Claude Desktop  
**So that** we can catch DXT configuration and integration issues before customers receive broken packages

## Story Details

### Current State Analysis

**Existing DXT Testing:**

- `tools/dxt/Makefile` has basic `make test` target that only tests bootstrap import
- No testing of the actual packaged `.dxt` file that customers receive
- No validation that the DXT works correctly when loaded by Claude Desktop
- Build failures often discovered after customer deployment when DXT fails to load

**Critical Gap - The Real Issue:**

- We build `.dxt` packages but never test them as bundled DXT configurations
- No validation that `manifest.json`, `bootstrap.py`, and `dxt_main.py` work together correctly
- No testing of the DXT package in the actual Claude Desktop MCP client environment
- Missing validation that the bundled configuration properly communicates via stdio transport

### Acceptance Criteria

#### AC1: Actual DXT Package Testing

- [x] Add `make test-dxt-package` target that tests the built `.dxt` file directly
- [x] Load the actual DXT package using `@anthropic-ai/dxt` CLI and validate it starts
- [x] Test that the bundled `manifest.json` is valid and properly configured
- [x] Verify that `bootstrap.py` creates the environment and loads dependencies correctly
- [x] Validate that `dxt_main.py` properly initializes the MCP server with stdio transport

#### AC2: Claude Desktop MCP Integration Testing

- [x] Simulate Claude Desktop MCP client communication with the bundled DXT
- [x] Test the complete MCP handshake, tool discovery, and tool execution flow
- [x] Validate that all 84+ tools are properly registered and callable through the DXT
- [x] Test error handling when DXT encounters issues during operation
- [x] Verify proper cleanup when DXT is terminated

#### AC3: DXT Configuration Validation

- [x] Test authentication vs. non-authenticated DXT modes work correctly
- [x] Validate environment variable propagation to bundled server (including edge cases)
- [x] Test DXT compatibility matrix with different Claude Desktop versions
- [x] Verify DXT logging doesn't interfere with MCP protocol communication
- [x] Test concurrent Claude Desktop instance connections

#### AC4: Customer Environment Simulation

- [x] Test DXT package in clean environments (no existing Python/dependencies)
- [x] Validate DXT works with different Python versions available on system
- [x] Test common customer failure scenarios (permission issues, network restrictions)
- [x] Test resource-constrained environments (memory/CPU limits)
- [x] Test network resilience scenarios (timeouts, proxy configurations)
- [x] Verify DXT package integrity and checksums before testing

#### AC5: Performance and Reliability Validation

- [x] Test DXT startup time performance benchmarks
- [x] Validate tool execution speed under normal and load conditions
- [x] Test memory usage patterns and resource cleanup
- [x] Verify version drift handling for dependency mismatches

    @echo "Comprehensive DXT testing complete"
```

### Implementation Details

#### Phase 1: DXT Package Loading and Validation

1. **Test actual DXT package loading**:

   ```python
   # Test that built .dxt package can be loaded by @anthropic-ai/dxt CLI
   def test_dxt_package_loads():
       dxt_path = "build/quilt-mcp-server.dxt"
       result = subprocess.run(["npx", "@anthropic-ai/dxt", "validate", dxt_path])
       assert result.returncode == 0
   ```

2. **Validate DXT configuration components**:
   - Test `manifest.json` has correct MCP server configuration
   - Verify `bootstrap.py` executes successfully in clean environment
   - Test `dxt_main.py` starts MCP server with proper stdio transport

#### Phase 2: Claude Desktop MCP Integration Testing

1. **Simulate Claude Desktop MCP client**:

   ```python
   # Test DXT communicates correctly with MCP client via stdio
   def test_mcp_client_communication():
       dxt_process = start_dxt_package()  # Start the actual .dxt package
       mcp_client = MCPTestClient(dxt_process.stdin, dxt_process.stdout)
       
       # Test MCP handshake
       response = mcp_client.initialize()
       assert response["capabilities"]["tools"] is not None
       
       # Test tool discovery
       tools = mcp_client.list_tools()
       assert len(tools) >= 84  # Verify all tools are registered
   ```

2. **End-to-end tool execution testing**:
   - Test that tools can be invoked through the DXT package
   - Verify tool responses are properly formatted for MCP protocol
   - Test error handling when tools fail or encounter issues

#### Phase 3: Customer Environment Testing

1. **Clean environment testing**:

   ```python
   # Test DXT package works in environment with no pre-existing dependencies
   def test_clean_environment_installation():
       with TemporaryDirectory() as temp_dir:
           # Copy DXT package to clean directory
           # Test that bootstrap.py creates venv and installs dependencies
           # Verify DXT starts correctly without any pre-existing setup
   ```

2. **Resource constraint testing**:

   ```python
   # Test DXT behavior under memory/CPU constraints
   def test_resource_constrained_environment():
       # Limit available memory and CPU
       # Test DXT startup and tool execution
       # Verify graceful degradation or failure messages
   ```

3. **Network resilience testing**:

   ```python
   # Test DXT handles network issues during operation
   def test_network_timeout_scenarios():
       # Simulate network timeouts during tool execution
       # Test proxy configuration scenarios
       # Verify recovery and error handling
   ```

4. **Different Python version testing**:
   - Test DXT package with Python 3.11, 3.12, etc.
   - Verify graceful failure with unsupported Python versions
   - Test that DXT finds and uses correct Python executable

#### Phase 4: Performance and Reliability Testing

1. **Performance benchmarking**:

   ```python
   # Test DXT startup performance
   def test_dxt_startup_time():
       start_time = time.time()
       dxt_process = start_dxt_package()
       startup_time = time.time() - start_time
       assert startup_time < 5.0  # 5 second startup SLA
   
   # Test tool execution performance
   def test_tool_execution_speed():
       # Measure time for common tool operations
       # Verify performance within acceptable thresholds
   ```

2. **Concurrent access testing**:

   ```python
   # Test multiple Claude Desktop instances
   def test_concurrent_claude_connections():
       # Start multiple MCP clients simultaneously
       # Verify all can connect and execute tools
       # Test resource sharing and isolation
   ```

3. **Version drift handling**:

   ```python
   # Test DXT handles dependency version mismatches
   def test_dependency_version_compatibility():
       # Test with different dependency versions
       # Verify graceful handling of version conflicts
   ```

### Dependencies

**External Dependencies:**

- `@anthropic-ai/dxt` CLI for DXT package validation and testing
- pytest framework (already in use)
- MCP client testing library or custom MCP test harness
- Docker (for clean environment testing)

**Internal Dependencies:**

- Built `.dxt` package from existing `tools/dxt/Makefile` system
- Current `bootstrap.py`, `dxt_main.py`, and `manifest.json` assets
- Actual MCP server code in `app/quilt_mcp/` (as bundled in DXT)

### Test Priority Framework

**P0 Critical (Must Pass):**

- DXT package loads via @anthropic-ai/dxt CLI
- MCP handshake succeeds with timeout handling
- All 84+ tools discoverable and executable
- Bootstrap creates environment correctly

**P1 High (Should Pass):**

- Tool execution through DXT package under normal conditions
- Error handling and recovery scenarios
- Clean environment installation
- Different Python version compatibility

**P2 Medium (Nice to Pass):**

- Performance under load conditions
- Advanced configuration scenarios
- Detailed logging validation
- Concurrent access scenarios

### Risks and Mitigations

#### Risk 1: Performance testing may identify bottlenecks requiring optimization

- **Mitigation**: Establish baseline performance metrics, implement tiered testing (P0 fast, P1/P2 comprehensive)
- **Fallback**: Performance issues become separate optimization stories

#### Risk 2: Concurrent access testing complexity

- **Mitigation**: Start with simple dual-client scenarios, expand based on real usage patterns
- **Fallback**: Document concurrent usage limitations if complex scenarios fail

#### Risk 3: Resource constraint testing may be environment-specific

- **Mitigation**: Use containerization for consistent resource limitation, test on representative hardware
- **Fallback**: Document minimum system requirements based on test results

#### Risk 4: Testing actual DXT packages increases build time

- **Mitigation**: Implement fast/comprehensive modes, run P0 tests in parallel
- **Fallback**: Make comprehensive testing optional for development builds

### Definition of Done

- [x] DXT package loading and validation tests implemented
- [x] MCP client simulation tests verify actual DXT functionality
- [x] Customer environment tests validate DXT works in clean environments
- [x] New test targets integrated into `tools/dxt/Makefile`
- [x] All tests validate the actual built `.dxt` package, not just source code
- [x] Existing DXT build workflow continues to function unchanged

### Success Metrics

- **DXT Package Validation**: 100% of built DXT packages pass P0 critical tests
- **MCP Integration**: All 84+ tools discoverable and executable with <2s average response time
- **Environment Compatibility**: DXT package works in >95% of tested customer environments
- **Performance Standards**: DXT startup <5s, tool execution <10s average
