# MCP Server Status Overview

Last updated: 2025-10-20

This report consolidates the most actionable findings from the detailed analyses in
`docs/archive/`. Use it as the jumping-off point before diving into the archived
reports.

## Current Capability Snapshot

- **Core functionality**: 40 scenario simulation shows 60% pass rate today, but
  easily rises toward ~75% when missing tool registrations return ([full
  analysis](../archive/MCP_COMPREHENSIVE_ANALYSIS.md)).
- **Performance**: Typical tool invocations complete in 150-400â€¯ms with stable concurrent execution and no crash regressions observed.
- **Strengths**: Package operations, authentication checks, S3 tooling, and error handling are consistently reliable.

## Outstanding Gaps

- **Missing MCP tool registrations** block ~30% of scenarios, leaving the Cursor
  deployment without any Quilt MCP coverage (see
  [gap analysis](../archive/COMPREHENSIVE_GAP_ANALYSIS.md)).
- **Athena and federated search workflows** remain inaccessible in production
  environments until Quilt tools are exposed and credentials validated.
- **Benchling MCP polish**: a handful of entity retrieval and creation endpoints need fixes before the dual-MCP story is complete.

## Recent Wins

- **CI coverage breakthrough**: execution jumped from 28% to 89% after enabling
  real AWS credentials (`make -C app test-ci`) and cleaning up pytest
  configuration ([details](../archive/CI_SUCCESS_SUMMARY.md)).
- **Table formatting + AWS infra (PR #64)** delivered readable ASCII output,
  279 passing tests, and stable integration against
  `quilt-sandbox-bucket` ([summary](../archive/FINAL_SUCCESS_SUMMARY.md)).

## Recommended Next Actions

1. **Restore Quilt MCP tool availability** in Cursor by fixing registrations and
   configuration so high-value stories (federated discovery, package lifecycle,
   unified search) become testable.
2. **Triage Athena authentication**: improve credential validation and messaging to unlock analytics workflows.
3. **Close the remaining CI loop** by resolving the expected S3 permission
   failures or swapping the test bucket, then extend AWS-backed tests to cover
   more scenarios.
