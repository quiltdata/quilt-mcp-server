- R004: Lists objects but doesn't create package from them

**Impact**: Users get partial solutions requiring manual follow-up

**Recommendation**: Implement operation chaining or suggest next steps

### **2. Permission Discovery Contradiction**
**Issue**: Claims no access to buckets we're actively using
**Evidence**: 
- Reports "no access" to quilt-sandbox-bucket
- Yet successfully lists, searches, and browses packages in that bucket

**Impact**: Misleading information that could confuse users

**Recommendation**: Fix credential handling in permission discovery

### **3. Context Misinterpretation**
**Issue**: MCP sometimes misunderstands user intent
**Examples**:
- R005: Compared different packages instead of package versions

**Impact**: Users get related but incorrect results

**Recommendation**: Improve natural language understanding

## üìà MCP Decision-Making Patterns
