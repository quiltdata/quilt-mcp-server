## üß™ **Testing Methodology**

### Tools Used
- **Qurator Interface**: Browser-based MCP client testing
- **Natural Language Queries**: Testing how well the tool handles conversational requests
- **Real Production Environment**: Testing against live ECS deployment

### Test Approach
1. Create new workflow from scratch
2. Add step to workflow
3. List all workflows (verify creation)
4. Get detailed status (verify state)
5. Update step status (verify mutation)

### Why This Approach Works
- Tests real user workflows, not just API calls
- Validates integration with Qurator AI layer
- Confirms tools work in production environment
- Tests natural language understanding of tool actions
