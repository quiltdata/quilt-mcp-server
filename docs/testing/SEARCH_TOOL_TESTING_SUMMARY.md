- ‚úÖ Grouped results by type (cell analysis, metadata)
- ‚úÖ Provided contextual information about cell painting workflow

**Performance**: ~19 seconds total (multiple searches)  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Working excellently

#### Test 1b: Package Search
**Query**: "Search for all packages in the cellpainting-gallery bucket"

**Tool Calls**: 2 search invocations (7:50:44, 7:50:51)

**Result**: Successfully searched for packages
- ‚úÖ Correctly reported **no packages in cellpainting-gallery bucket**
- ‚úÖ Explained the bucket contains raw data files, not packages
- ‚úÖ Offered helpful suggestions (explore contents or create packages)

**Performance**: ~13 seconds  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Working correctly with intelligent null-result handling

---

### 2. `suggest` - ‚úÖ PASSED
**Query**: "What search suggestions do you have for 'genom'?"

**Tool Invoked**: 7:51:44 AM

**Result**: Successfully provided search suggestions
- ‚úÖ **Suggestion**: "packages about genomics"
- ‚úÖ **Context**: Explained relevance to CellxGene, CCLE, HiSeq2500 data
- ‚úÖ **Follow-up Options**:
  - Search for genomics-related packages
  - Look for specific genomic file formats (FASTQ, BAM, VCF)
  - Explore CellxGene buckets
  - Examine CCLE repositories

**Performance**: ~7 seconds  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Working with excellent contextual intelligence

---

### 3. `explain` - ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL (No explicit action, but Qurator explains naturally)
**Query**: "Explain how you would search for 'cancer cell line data'"

**Tool Invoked**: search (7:52:20 AM)

**Result**: Qurator provided **comprehensive 5-step search strategy**
- ‚úÖ **Step 1**: Define Clear Search Strategy (unified search, catalog scope, no filters)
- ‚úÖ **Step 2**: Focus on Relevant Buckets (CCLE, CellxGene)
- ‚úÖ **Step 3**: Refine with Specific Terms (cancer types, genes, RNA-seq)
- ‚úÖ **Step 4**: Examine Metadata and Descriptions
- ‚úÖ **Step 5**: Utilize File Type Filtering (FASTQ, CSV, TSV, HDF5)

**Finding**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **No explicit `explain` action exists** in the search tool
- The action is listed in the docstring but not implemented in the dispatcher
- However, Qurator **naturally explains search strategies** through its AI layer
- **This works well in practice** but the action isn't directly callable

**Performance**: ~18 seconds  
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **Missing implementation** but **UX compensates**

---

### 4. `discover` - ‚úÖ PASSED
**Query**: "What search capabilities and backends are available?"

**Tool Invoked**: 7:53:20 AM

**Result**: Successfully listed search capabilities
- ‚úÖ **Backends**: GraphQL (primary search backend)
- ‚úÖ **Search Scopes**:
  - Global (across all resources)
  - Catalog (across all buckets)
  - Package (within specific package)
  - Bucket (within specific bucket)
- ‚úÖ **Search Types**: Packages, Objects, Both
- ‚úÖ **Features**: Unified search, intelligent suggestions, auto backend selection

**Additional Context**: Explained how to use unified search for cancer cell line data

**Performance**: ~13 seconds  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Working perfectly

---

### 5. `search_packages` / `search_objects` - ‚úÖ IMPLICITLY TESTED
**Testing Method**: Through `unified_search` with automatic type detection

**Results**:
- ‚úÖ **Package search** worked (Test 1b: "all packages in cellpainting-gallery")
- ‚úÖ **Object search** worked (Test 1a: "CSV files in cellpainting-gallery")
- ‚úÖ **Auto-detection** recognized "files" ‚Üí objects, "packages" ‚Üí packages

**Note**: These are separate actions but were tested through unified_search's intelligent routing

**Status**: ‚úÖ Working correctly through unified search

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Issues Found**

### Issue: `explain` action not implemented
**Priority**: Low  
**Tool**: search  
**Action**: explain  
**Status**: Not Implemented

**Details**:
- Action is **listed in docstring** (line 408): "explain: Explain how a search query would be processed"
- Action is **NOT in the actions list** returned by discovery mode (line 439-444)
- Action is **NOT in the dispatcher** (no `elif action == "explain"` clause)

**Impact**: Low - Qurator's AI layer naturally explains search strategies without needing an explicit `explain` action

**Workaround**: Users can ask "How would you search for X?" and Qurator provides excellent explanations

**Recommendation**: Either:
1. ‚úÖ **Implement the `explain` action** to match the docstring promise
2. ‚úÖ **Remove from docstring** if not needed (since AI explains naturally)

**GitHub Issue**: Should be created to track this discrepancy

---

---

## üêõ **Issues to Address**

### Issue #1: `explain` action listed but not implemented

**Priority**: Low  
**Type**: Documentation/Implementation Mismatch

**Description**:
The `search` tool's docstring promises an `explain` action:
```python
Available actions:
- discover: Discover search capabilities and available backends
- unified_search: Intelligent unified search with automatic backend selection
- suggest: Get intelligent search suggestions based on partial queries
- explain: Explain how a search query would be processed  # ‚Üê Listed here
```

However, the action is:
- ‚ùå **Not in the discovery response** (lines 439-444)
- ‚ùå **Not in the dispatcher** (no `elif action == "explain"` clause)
- ‚ùå **Not callable** by clients

**Impact**: Low - Qurator's AI naturally explains search strategies when asked

**Workaround**: Ask "How would you search for X?" instead of calling `explain` action

**Recommendation**: Choose one:
1. Implement the `explain` action (add to dispatcher, call `explain_query=True` on unified_search)
2. Remove from docstring if not needed

**GitHub Issue**: To be created

## üîç **Code Analysis**

### Implemented Actions (from `src/quilt_mcp/tools/search.py`)
```python
# Discovery mode returns (lines 438-444):
"actions": [
    "discover",          # ‚úÖ Tested, Working
    "unified_search",    # ‚úÖ Tested, Working
    "search_packages",   # ‚úÖ Implicitly tested through unified_search
    "search_objects",    # ‚úÖ Implicitly tested through unified_search
    "suggest",           # ‚úÖ Tested, Working
]
```

### Dispatcher Implementation
- ‚úÖ `discover` - Line 447-448
- ‚úÖ `search_packages` - Lines 449-495
- ‚úÖ `search_objects` - Lines 496-542
- ‚úÖ `unified_search` - Lines 543-605
- ‚úÖ `suggest` - Line 606-607
- ‚ùå `explain` - **Missing** (no dispatcher clause)

### Docstring Claims (lines 405-408)
```python
Available actions:
- discover: Discover search capabilities and available backends
- unified_search: Intelligent unified search with automatic backend selection
- suggest: Get intelligent search suggestions based on partial queries

---

## üìù **GitHub Issues to Create**

### Issue: search tool lists `explain` action in docstring but doesn't implement it

**Priority**: Low  
**Labels**: bug, documentation, search, enhancement

**Description**:
The `search` tool's docstring (line 408) lists an `explain` action:
```
- explain: Explain how a search query would be processed
```

However, this action is:
1. Not returned in discovery mode (lines 438-444)
2. Not implemented in the dispatcher (lines 447-609)
3. Not callable by clients

**Expected Behavior**:
Either implement the `explain` action or remove it from the docstring to match actual implementation.

**Actual Behavior**:
Docstring promises `explain` action that doesn't exist.

**Impact**: Low - Qurator's AI naturally explains search strategies when users ask

**Environment**:
- Version: 0.6.59
- File: `src/quilt_mcp/tools/search.py`
- Lines: 408 (docstring), 438-444 (discovery), 447-609 (dispatcher)

**Suggested Fix**:
Option 1: Implement `explain` action that returns structured query analysis
Option 2: Remove `explain` from docstring at line 408

**Workaround**:
Users can ask "How would you search for X?" and Qurator provides excellent explanations through its AI layer.
