# Quilt MCP Test Case Adjustments Summary

## Overview
I've adjusted the ChatGPT-suggested test cases to align with actual Quilt functionality and the available MCP tools. Here are the key categories of changes made:

## Major Adjustments Made

### 1. **Removed Non-Existent Features**
- **Approval Workflows**: Quilt doesn't have built-in approval/publishing workflows
- **Package-Level ACLs**: Quilt uses S3/IAM permissions, not package-specific access controls
- **Nextflow Integration**: No built-in Nextflow integration (though can reference in metadata)
- **Benchling Sync**: No direct Benchling integration in core Quilt
- **PII Detection**: No automatic PII detection/removal features
- **Scheduling/Alerting**: No built-in job scheduling or notification system
- **Audit Logs**: No user activity audit trail functionality
- **Qurator**: Not a standard Quilt feature

### 2. **Simplified Overly Complex Scenarios**
- **Biological Specificity**: Removed overly specific biological terms (RIN scores, hepatocytes) for broader applicability
- **Multi-Tenant Auth**: Simplified complex IdP scenarios to basic authentication status
- **Cross-Bucket Operations**: Simplified complex migration scenarios to basic operations
- **Statistical Analysis**: Removed complex statistical operations not built into Quilt
- **Workflow Timing**: Removed time-to-publish metrics (not tracked by Quilt)

### 3. **Aligned with Actual MCP Tools**
Each test case now specifies the actual MCP tools that would be used:
- `mcp_quilt_packages_search` for package discovery
- `mcp_quilt_package_browse` for exploring package contents
- `mcp_quilt_create_package_enhanced` for package creation
- `mcp_quilt_tabulator_*` tools for SQL querying
- `mcp_quilt_athena_*` tools for Athena integration
- `mcp_quilt_aws_permissions_discover` for permission checking

### 4. **Focused on Core Quilt Capabilities**
- **Package Management**: Create, update, browse, compare packages
- **Metadata Handling**: Templates, validation, structured metadata
- **Search & Discovery**: Package and object search across buckets
- **S3 Integration**: Direct S3 operations with presigned URLs
- **Tabulator/Athena**: SQL querying of package data
- **Permissions**: AWS/S3 permission discovery and checking
- **Visualization**: Quilt's built-in visualization generation

### 5. **Maintained Realistic User Personas**
- **Bench Scientist**: Basic package operations and metadata
- **Bioinformatician**: Advanced package creation and data linking
- **Data Engineer**: Permissions, validation, and system operations
- **R&D IT**: Configuration, templates, and system management
- **Scientist**: Analysis, visualization, and documentation
- **Program Manager**: Reporting, compliance, and inventory
- **Analyst**: SQL querying, exports, and data analysis

## Key Realistic Features Preserved

### ✅ **What Quilt Actually Does Well**
1. **Package Versioning**: Complete version history and diff capabilities
2. **Metadata Templates**: Structured metadata with validation
3. **S3 Integration**: Native S3 operations with presigned URLs
4. **Search**: Elasticsearch-powered search across packages and objects
5. **Tabulator**: SQL interface for querying package data
6. **Athena Integration**: Direct Athena querying capabilities
7. **Visualization**: Built-in visualization generation
8. **Permission Discovery**: AWS permission analysis and recommendations

### ✅ **MCP-Specific Capabilities**
1. **Direct Tool Access**: All operations use actual MCP tools
2. **Error Handling**: Realistic error scenarios with proper validation
3. **Performance Testing**: Concurrent operations and caching behavior
4. **System Status**: Authentication, filesystem, and capability checking
5. **Troubleshooting**: Validation failures and remediation guidance

## Test Categories by Complexity

### **Basic (Good for Initial Testing)**
- R001-R005: Basic package operations
- R015, R017, R018: System status and configuration
- R036-R040: Error handling and troubleshooting

### **Intermediate (Core Functionality)**
- R006-R014: Advanced package operations
- R019-R025: Tabulator and visualization
- R031-R035: Analysis and reporting

### **Advanced (Full Integration)**
- R016, R020: Metadata templates and validation
- R024, R031: Athena/SQL operations
- R011-R012: AWS permissions and S3 operations

## Usage Recommendations

1. **Start with Basic Tests**: Validate core MCP connectivity and basic operations
2. **Progress to Intermediate**: Test package creation, search, and metadata handling
3. **Finish with Advanced**: Test complex integrations like Athena and AWS permissions
4. **Focus on Error Cases**: Use R036-R038 to validate error handling
5. **Performance Testing**: Use R040 and concurrent operations for performance validation

These adjusted test cases provide realistic validation of Quilt's actual capabilities while ensuring all tests can be executed using the available MCP tools.
