"""MCP tools for Quilt data access.

This package contains all the MCP tool implementations organized by functionality:
- catalog: Catalog configuration, status, and onboarding
- buckets: S3 bucket operations
- packages: Package browsing and search
- package_creation: Package creation workflows
- permissions: AWS permissions discovery and bucket recommendations
- metadata_templates: Metadata templates and validation utilities
- athena_glue: AWS Athena queries and Glue Data Catalog discovery
- tabulator: Quilt tabulator table management for SQL querying across packages

These tools are pure functions that are registered by the tools module.

Example usage:
    from quilt_mcp.tools import catalog, buckets, packages, package_creation

    # Use catalog tools
    status = catalog.catalog_status()

    # Use bucket tools
    objects = buckets.bucket_objects_list("my-bucket")

    # Use package tools
    pkg_info = packages.package_browse("team/dataset")
