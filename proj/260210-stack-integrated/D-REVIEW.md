# Code Quality & Readiness Review

> Version 1.0 | February 16, 2026

## Purpose

This document provides a **go/no-go quality checklist** for code readiness. It validates that the
stack-integrated implementation is ready for production deployment from a **codebase quality**
perspective.

**Note:** This is NOT a full infrastructure/operations review. This focuses on code quality, test
coverage, maintainability, and basic deployability.

This review distinguishes between **measured checks** (tool-enforced, reproducible) and **assessed
checks** (human judgment based on evidence). Both are required for a go/no-go decision.

All review outputs are written to `./review/` for documentation and tracking.

## Quality Gates

### 1. Code Coverage & Testing

**Criteria:**

- [x] Overall code coverage ≥ 80% (measured) - ✅ 86.0% combined
- [x] Critical paths coverage ≥ 90% (backends, tools, auth) - ❌ backends 82.1%, tools 89.7%, auth 88.9%
- [x] No skipped tests in production code paths - ⚠️ runtime skips present in fixtures/e2e
- [x] No xfail tests masking actual failures - ✅ none found via `rg` scan
- [x] Integration tests use real backends (minimal mocking) - ⚠️ func tests include notable mocking
- [x] E2E tests cover both local and remote modes - ⚠️ dual-mode harness present; execution env-gated
- [x] All tests pass in CI/CD - 🔍 not re-verified in this run

**Verification Commands:**

```bash
# Generate coverage report
make coverage

# Check for skipped/xfail tests
uv run pytest --collect-only -m "not slow" | grep -E "(SKIPPED|XFAIL)"

# Review test configuration
cat scripts/tests/coverage_required.yaml
```

**Output:** `./review/01-testing.md`

**Checklist:**

- Actual coverage % by module
- List of any skipped tests with justification
- Integration test mocking inventory
- Critical gaps identified
- Pass/fail status

---

### 2. Build & Deployability

**Criteria:**

- [x] `make test-all` passes cleanly - ❌ stalled in Docker phase (terminated)
- [x] `make lint` passes (no warnings) - ✅ pass
- [x] Docker image builds successfully - ❌ `make docker-build` stalled (Error 143 after termination)
- [x] MCPB package builds successfully - ✅ `dist/quilt-mcp-0.19.0.mcpb`
- [x] No uncommitted changes required for deployment - ⚠️ generated validation artifacts changed
- [x] CI/CD pipeline green - ⚠️ latest main run in progress; recent prior runs successful
- [x] Dependencies properly pinned (pyproject.toml) - ⚠️ range constraints (`>=`) used

**Verification Commands:**

```bash
# Full build validation
make clean
make test-all
make lint
make docker-build
make mcpb

# Check CI status
gh workflow list
gh run list --limit 5
```

**Output:** `./review/02-deployability.md`

**Checklist:**

- Build status (pass/fail)
- Lint issues (count)
- Docker image size/tags
- CI/CD status
- Deployment blockers

---

### 3. Code Maintainability

**Criteria:**

- [x] No modules > 500 lines (measured) - ❌ multiple modules exceed 500 LOC (max 2034)
- [x] Cyclomatic complexity reasonable (< 15 per function, assessed) - ⚠️ `radon` unavailable; risk appears high in large modules
- [x] Clear module boundaries (no circular imports) - ❌ static import scan found 15 cycles
- [x] Type hints present (mypy passing) - ✅ pass (124 files)
- [x] No TODO/FIXME in production paths - ❌ TODO found in `src/quilt_mcp/tools/packages.py`
- [x] Code follows project conventions - ✅ lint/mypy clean

**Verification Commands:**

```bash
# Module size analysis
find src/quilt_mcp -name "*.py" -exec wc -l {} \; | sort -rn | head -20

# Check for TODOs in critical paths
grep -r "TODO\|FIXME" src/quilt_mcp/{backends,tools,ops}/ || echo "None found"

# Type checking
uv run mypy src/quilt_mcp

# Complexity (if installed)
uv run radon cc src/quilt_mcp -a -nb
```

**Output:** `./review/03-maintainability.md`

**Checklist:**

- Module size distribution
- Complexity hotspots
- TODO/FIXME inventory
- Type coverage
- Refactoring needs

---

### 4. Documentation

**Criteria:**

- [x] README.md up to date with deployment modes - ✅ local/remote/legacy documented
- [x] ARCHITECTURE.md reflects current design - ⚠️ root `ARCHITECTURE.md` missing; `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` present
- [x] MCP tool descriptions complete and accurate - ⚠️ checklist command references non-exported `TOOLS` symbol
- [x] Configuration variables documented - ✅ `QUILT_*` vars documented across README/docs
- [x] Deployment guide exists (local + remote) - ⚠️ covered in README; `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` missing
- [x] Troubleshooting section present - ✅ `docs/SEARCH_TROUBLESHOOTING.md` present

**Verification:**

```bash
# Check key docs exist
ls -lh README.md ARCHITECTURE.md docs/DEPLOYMENT.md

# Verify MCP tool documentation
uv run python -c "from quilt_mcp.tools import TOOLS; print(f'{len(TOOLS)} tools')"

# Check configuration docs
grep -r "QUILT_" README.md docs/
```

**Output:** `./review/04-documentation.md`

**Checklist:**

- Documentation completeness (%)
- Outdated sections identified
- Missing content
- Accuracy verification

---

### 5. Security & Credentials

**Scope note:** This gate checks for obvious *code-level security failures* (e.g., credential
leakage, unsafe defaults). It does **not** replace threat modeling, penetration testing, or formal
security audits.

**Criteria:**

- [ ] No hardcoded credentials/secrets
- [ ] IAM credentials never logged
- [ ] JWT tokens handled securely (no leakage)
- [ ] Input validation on tool parameters
- [ ] SQL injection prevention (if applicable)
- [ ] Secure defaults for all configurations
- [ ] Credential isolation between modes verified

**Verification:**

```bash
# Search for potential credential leaks
grep -r "password\|secret\|token" src/quilt_mcp/ --exclude-dir=__pycache__ | grep -v "test"

# Check logging for credential leakage
grep -r "logger.*credential\|logger.*token" src/quilt_mcp/

# Review auth code
cat src/quilt_mcp/backends/quilt3_backend_session.py
cat src/quilt_mcp/context/request_context.py
```

**Output:** `./review/05-security.md`

**Checklist:**

- Security scan results
- Credential handling review
- Input validation coverage
- Known vulnerabilities
- Remediation priority

---

### 6. Observability

**Scope note:** This section focuses on *observability* (logs, errors, retries). Operational
concerns such as alerting, dashboards, and SLOs are intentionally out of scope.

**Criteria:**

- [ ] Structured logging in place
- [ ] Error messages actionable (not just stack traces)
- [ ] Critical operations logged (auth, backend selection)
- [ ] No sensitive data in logs
- [ ] Exception handling consistent
- [ ] Timeout/retry logic present

**Verification:**

```bash
# Review logging patterns
grep -r "logger\." src/quilt_mcp/{backends,tools,ops}/ | head -20

# Check error handling
grep -r "except Exception" src/quilt_mcp/

# Review critical paths
cat src/quilt_mcp/backends/quilt3_backend_session.py
cat src/quilt_mcp/backends/quiltops_graphql_backend.py
```

**Output:** `./review/06-observability.md`

**Checklist:**

- Logging coverage assessment
- Error handling patterns
- Missing observability
- Log sanitization check

---

### 7. Scope Alignment (High-Level)

**Criteria:**

- [ ] Single codebase deploys to both local and remote modes
- [ ] Backend abstraction (QuiltOps) fully implemented
- [ ] Local mode uses Quilt3, remote uses GraphQL
- [ ] Stateful operations disabled in multiuser mode
- [ ] Admin/user role split working
- [ ] Feature parity documented for both modes

**Verification:**

```bash
# Verify dual deployment capability
grep -r "QUILT_MULTIUSER_MODE" src/quilt_mcp/

# Check backend abstraction
ls src/quilt_mcp/ops/
ls src/quilt_mcp/backends/

# Verify mode-specific features
grep -r "@requires_local_mode\|@requires_admin" src/quilt_mcp/tools/
```

**Output:** `./review/07-scope-alignment.md`

**Checklist:**

- Scope objectives met (Y/N per objective)
- Major deviations from design
- Feature parity matrix
- Alignment assessment

---

### 8. Design Compliance (High-Level)

**Criteria:**

- [ ] Backend abstraction layer implemented (ops/ interfaces)
- [ ] Both backends (Quilt3, GraphQL) functional
- [ ] Request-scoped context working (no global state)
- [ ] Dual authentication (IAM + JWT) functional
- [ ] Tool availability dynamically advertised
- [ ] No architectural violations

**Verification:**

```bash
# Check abstraction layer
ls -lh src/quilt_mcp/ops/
grep -r "class.*Backend" src/quilt_mcp/backends/

# Verify context isolation
cat src/quilt_mcp/context/request_context.py

# Check tool discovery
grep -r "list_tools\|list_resources" src/quilt_mcp/
```

**Output:** `./review/08-design-compliance.md`

**Checklist:**

- Design decisions implemented (Y/N per decision)
- Architectural integrity
- Major deviations
- Compliance assessment
