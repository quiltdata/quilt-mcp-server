# JWT Authentication Fix Deployed

## ✅ Issue Resolved

**Problem:** ECS task definition had wrong JWT secret
- Had: `development-enhanced-jwt-secret` (31 chars) ❌
- Needed: `quilt-sales-prod-mcp-jwt-secret-2025-enhanced-tokens-v2` (55 chars) ✅

**Solution:** Manually updated task definition to revision 77 with correct secret

## 🚀 Deployment Status

**Task Definition:** Revision 77 (ACTIVE) ✅
**JWT Secret:** `quilt-sales-prod-mcp-jwt-secret-2025-enhanced-tokens-v2` ✅
**Secret Length:** 55 chars (matches frontend) ✅
**Status:** RUNNING & HEALTHY ✅
**Rollout:** COMPLETED ✅

## ✅ Token Validation Confirmed

Tested your JWT token locally - it validates successfully with the new secret:
```
✅ TOKEN VALIDATES SUCCESSFULLY!
User: 8795f0cc-8deb-40dd-9132-13357c983984
Buckets: 32
Permissions: 24
Roles: ReadWriteQuiltV2-sales-prod
```

## 🧪 Test Now!

**Frontend team:** Please refresh your browser and try using Qurator/MCP tools again.

The MCP server will now:
1. ✅ Allow session initialization (no auth needed)
2. ✅ Validate JWT on tool requests (with matching secret)
3. ✅ Log successful authentication with user/bucket/permission counts

## 📊 Expected Behavior

When you use an MCP tool, CloudWatch logs should show:
```
INFO: MCP request: method=POST path=/mcp has_auth=True
INFO: JWT authentication successful for user <username> (buckets=32, permissions=24, roles=ReadWriteQuiltV2-sales-prod)
```

## 🔍 If Still Failing

Run in browser console:
```javascript
// Force refresh the token
await window.__dynamicAuthManager.clearCache()
const newToken = await window.__dynamicAuthManager.getCurrentToken()
console.log('Token refreshed, length:', newToken.length)
```

Then try using an MCP tool again.

## 📋 Summary

- [x] JWT secret mismatch identified
- [x] Task definition updated with correct secret (rev 77)
- [x] Service deployed and healthy
- [x] Token validation confirmed locally
- [ ] Frontend to test and confirm working

**Next:** Frontend tests should now pass! 🎉
