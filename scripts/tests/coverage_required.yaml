# Coverage Requirements
#
# Defines minimum coverage thresholds for different test suites.
# Values are percentages (0-100).
#
# The test_coverage.py script will validate that actual coverage meets or exceeds these thresholds.

# Overall project coverage thresholds
summary:
  unit_pct_covered: 35.0           # Minimum unit test coverage (current baseline)
  integration_pct_covered: 45.0     # Minimum integration test coverage
  e2e_pct_covered: 35.0             # Minimum end-to-end test coverage
  combined_pct_covered: 50.0        # Minimum combined coverage across all test types

# Per-file coverage thresholds (optional)
# Only files explicitly listed here will be checked against per-file thresholds.
# Use this to enforce higher coverage on critical files or allow lower coverage
# on files that are difficult to test. Most files should NOT be listed here -
# the summary thresholds are sufficient for overall project health.
files:
  # Example: Critical files that require higher coverage
  # "src/quilt_mcp/core/auth.py":
  #   unit_pct_covered: 95.0
  #   combined_pct_covered: 95.0

  # Example: Files that may have lower coverage temporarily
  # "src/quilt_mcp/experimental/feature.py":
  #   combined_pct_covered: 50.0

# Strict mode: If true, fail if any file has zero coverage
# If false, only check files that appear in the coverage report
strict: false

# Allow list: Files that are exempt from coverage requirements
# These files will not cause test failures even with zero coverage
