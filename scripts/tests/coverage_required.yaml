# Coverage Requirements
#
# Defines minimum coverage thresholds for different test suites.
# Values are percentages (0-100).
#
# The test_coverage.py script will validate that actual coverage meets or exceeds these thresholds.
#
# PHILOSOPHY: We focus on combined coverage, which measures whether code is tested
# by ANY test suite (unit, integration, or e2e). What matters is that code is tested,
# not which test category it falls under.

# Overall project coverage thresholds
summary:
  # PRIMARY METRIC: Combined coverage measures if code is tested by ANY test type
  combined_pct_covered: 55.0        # Current: 56.7% - primary quality gate

# Per-file coverage thresholds (optional)
# Only files explicitly listed here will be checked against per-file thresholds.
# Use this to enforce higher coverage on critical files or allow lower coverage
# on files that are difficult to test. Most files should NOT be listed here -
# the summary thresholds are sufficient for overall project health.
files:
  # Example: Critical files that require higher coverage
  # "src/quilt_mcp/core/auth.py":
  #   unit_pct_covered: 95.0
  #   combined_pct_covered: 95.0

  # Example: Files that may have lower coverage temporarily
  # "src/quilt_mcp/experimental/feature.py":
  #   combined_pct_covered: 50.0

# Strict mode: If true, fail if any file has zero coverage
# If false, only check files that appear in the coverage report
strict: false

# Allow list: Files that are exempt from coverage requirements
# These files will not cause test failures even with zero coverage
exempt_files:
  - "*__init__.py"           # Package initialization files (often just imports)
  - "*__main__.py"           # Entry point files
  - "*/tests/*"              # Test code itself
  - "*/test_*.py"            # Test files
  - "scripts/*"              # Build/utility scripts

  # Known gaps to be addressed (see GitHub issue for improvements):
  - "*/visualization/*"      # ~1,296 lines untested - needs comprehensive test suite
  - "*/tools/stack_buckets.py"  # 95 lines untested - may be dead code
