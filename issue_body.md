## Overview

This issue outlines the implementation of a remote MCP Server deployment that integrates with the existing Quilt stack infrastructure. The goal is to deploy the MCP Server as a containerized service alongside existing Quilt services, making it accessible to the Quilt frontend and other clients.

## Objectives

### 1. AWS Environment Analysis
- [ ] Analyze the current `sales-prod` AWS deployment using AWS CLI
- [ ] Document existing infrastructure components (ECS, ALB, VPC, IAM roles, etc.)
- [ ] Identify integration points for the MCP Server
- [ ] Map out networking and security requirements

### 2. Deployment Strategy
- [ ] Design container deployment strategy for MCP Server
- [ ] Plan integration with existing Fargate tasks
- [ ] Define resource allocation and scaling requirements
- [ ] Establish monitoring and logging strategy

### 3. Repository Analysis
- [ ] Analyze `quiltdata/deployment` for current deployment patterns
- [ ] Review `quiltdata/iac` for Terraform module structure
- [ ] Study `quiltdata/quilt` for frontend integration requirements
- [ ] Examine `quiltdata/enterprise` for enterprise-specific patterns
- [ ] Document existing container orchestration and service discovery

### 4. Container Infrastructure
- [ ] Set up remote ECR repository for MCP Server images
- [ ] Implement multi-platform Docker builds (linux/amd64)
- [ ] Configure container health checks and monitoring
- [ ] Establish CI/CD pipeline for container updates

### 5. Frontend Integration
- [ ] Ensure MCP Server is accessible from Quilt frontend
- [ ] Implement proper CORS configuration
- [ ] Set up authentication and authorization
- [ ] Test MCP client-server communication

### 6. Best Practices Research
- [ ] Review MCP server hosting best practices
- [ ] Research container security best practices
- [ ] Study AWS Fargate optimization techniques
- [ ] Document performance and scalability considerations

### 7. Terraform Module Development
- [ ] Create reusable Terraform module for MCP Server deployment
- [ ] Design module to integrate with existing Quilt infrastructure
- [ ] Implement configurable parameters for different environments
- [ ] Add comprehensive documentation and examples
- [ ] Prepare module for integration into `quiltdata/iac` repository

### 8. CloudFormation Integration
- [ ] Analyze existing CloudFormation templates
- [ ] Design CloudFormation resources for MCP Server
- [ ] Ensure compatibility with existing stack updates
- [ ] Create CloudFormation template for standalone deployment

## Technical Requirements

### Infrastructure Components
- **Container Orchestration**: AWS ECS with Fargate
- **Container Registry**: AWS ECR
- **Load Balancing**: Application Load Balancer integration
- **Networking**: VPC, subnets, security groups
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch logs and metrics
- **Security**: IAM roles and policies

### MCP Server Features
- **Transport**: HTTP-based MCP protocol
- **Health Checks**: Dedicated health endpoint
- **CORS**: Proper cross-origin resource sharing
- **Authentication**: Integration with Quilt auth system
- **Logging**: Structured logging for debugging

### Integration Points
- **Frontend**: Quilt web application MCP client
- **Backend**: Existing Quilt services and APIs
- **Data**: S3, Athena, Glue integration
- **Monitoring**: Existing Quilt monitoring stack

## Success Criteria

1. **Functional**: MCP Server runs reliably in production environment
2. **Integrated**: Seamless integration with Quilt frontend
3. **Scalable**: Can handle expected load and scale appropriately
4. **Maintainable**: Easy to update and monitor
5. **Reusable**: Terraform module can be used by other teams
6. **Documented**: Comprehensive documentation for deployment and usage

## Deliverables

1. **Analysis Report**: AWS environment analysis and integration strategy
2. **Terraform Module**: Reusable module for MCP Server deployment
3. **CloudFormation Template**: Standalone deployment template
4. **Documentation**: Deployment guide and best practices
5. **Integration Guide**: Frontend integration instructions
6. **Testing Suite**: Comprehensive testing for all components

## Dependencies

- Access to `sales-prod` AWS environment
- Access to Quilt repositories (`deployment`, `iac`, `quilt`, `enterprise`)
- AWS CLI and Terraform CLI
- Docker and container registry access
- Quilt frontend development environment

## Timeline

- **Phase 1**: Analysis and Strategy (1-2 weeks)
- **Phase 2**: Infrastructure Development (2-3 weeks)
- **Phase 3**: Integration and Testing (1-2 weeks)
- **Phase 4**: Documentation and Deployment (1 week)

## Related Issues

- This builds upon the existing MCP Server implementation
- May require coordination with Quilt frontend team
- Could enable additional MCP server features in the future
